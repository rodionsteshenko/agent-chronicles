world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The engine's heart still glows faintly."
      first_appeared: null
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 3, Kael discovered he can do something impossible: pull his echo inward, 
        making it impossible for a Hollow to feed on him. This ability is unprecedented.
        
        In Scene 4, Kael learned his parents were researchers who studied the God-Engines 
        and found something that scared them into hiding. He now carries a mysterious 
        metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: alive
      arc_notes:
        - "Demonstrated unprecedented ability to 'fold' his echo inward"
        - "Committed to finding answers about his nature"
        - "Received mysterious metal disk from his mother (via Vera)"
        - "Departed for Vanthem with Tam"
  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world. Driven off by Kael but not destroyed.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: alive (retreated, nursing wounds)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (appears in messages/memories)"
      description: "Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. Somehow sent a message from beyond."
      first_appeared: 1
      status: dissolved (but conscious somewhere?)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares. Showed bravery 
        during the Hollow attack, refusing to leave Kael's side.
        
        In Scene 4, she insisted on accompanying Kael to Vanthem, refusing to let him face 
        the journey alone. She'd already spoken with Vera and helped prepare supplies.

      status: alive (traveling with Kael)

plot:
  current_act: 1  # 1=setup, 2=confrontation, 3=resolution
  current_chapter: 4
  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, is about to be pulled in when an echo-storm reveals something 
    that shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    The Hollow that followed Mira's message made the threat real. With the Guild 
    coming to investigate and possibly "collect" him, Kael had no choice but to 
    flee. With Tam at his side and a mysterious artifact from his parents, he's 
    heading to Vanthem to seek answers about what he is and what Mira found.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    Unable to sleep after the Hollow attack, Kael was visited by Tam, who informed him 
    that Old Man Garrett had already left to alert the Guild. With only 3-4 days before 
    Guild agents arrive, Kael had to flee. He decided to head to Vanthem to find answers 
    about Mira and his own abilities.
    
    Tam refused to let him go alone, having already arranged supplies with Vera. Before 
    he left, Vera revealed a shocking truth: his parents weren't simple villagers who 
    died in an echo-storm. They were researchers who studied the God-Engines, found 
    something that terrified them, and went into hiding. She gave him a mysterious metal 
    disk his mother had left behind, warm to the touch and inscribed with unknown symbols.
    
    Kael and Tam departed through the village gate at dawn, heading into the Rustfields 
    toward Vanthem.
  current_tension_level: 7
  pending_revelations:
    - "The God-Engines are responding to something specific"
    - "Mira didn't dissolve - she went somewhere else"
    - "Why can Kael do things other Tuners can't?"
    - "What is the Hollow, and where did it go?"
    - "What did Kael's parents discover about the God-Engines?"
    - "What is the mysterious metal disk and what does it do?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed"
    - "Vera's reaction suggests she may know more than she's saying - revealed in Scene 4"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who found something terrifying"
    - "The metal disk is warm - it may be reacting to Kael's echo"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "The journey through the Rustfields. First night camping, establishing the dynamic between Kael and Tam. Possibly an encounter with an echo-storm or Changed beasts. The Hollow may be tracking them from a distance."
  characters_involved:
    - Kael Thornwood
    - Tam
  location: "The Rustfields"
  tone: "Journey/adventure with underlying tension - they're being pursued from multiple directions"
