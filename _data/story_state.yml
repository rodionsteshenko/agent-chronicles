world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The engine's heart still glows faintly."
      first_appeared: null
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2
    - name: "Rustfield Waystation"
      description: "An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement used by salvagers for generations. Fire ring, tallied walls, stacked wood for travelers."
      first_appeared: 5

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 3, Kael discovered he can do something impossible: pull his echo inward, 
        making it impossible for a Hollow to feed on him. This ability is unprecedented.
        
        In Scene 4, Kael learned his parents were researchers who studied the God-Engines 
        and found something that scared them into hiding. He now carries a mysterious 
        metal disk his mother left behind.
        
        In Scene 5, Kael discovered the disk responds only to him - warm to his touch but 
        cold to Tam. During his night watch, he sensed something vast and ancient pulse back 
        through the disk.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: alive
      arc_notes:
        - "Demonstrated unprecedented ability to 'fold' his echo inward"
        - "Committed to finding answers about his nature"
        - "Received mysterious metal disk from his parents (via Vera)"
        - "Departed for Vanthem with Tam"
        - "Disk responds only to him - may be keyed to his unique nature"
        - "Felt a distant, ancient presence respond through the disk"
  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world. Driven off by Kael but not destroyed.
        
        In Scene 5, Kael spotted a distant flicker along their path - possibly the Hollow tracking them.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: alive (tracking Kael through the Rustfields)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (appears in messages/memories)"
      description: "Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. Somehow sent a message from beyond."
      first_appeared: 1
      status: dissolved (but conscious somewhere?)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares. Showed bravery 
        during the Hollow attack, refusing to leave Kael's side.
        
        Insisted on accompanying Kael to Vanthem. The disk is cold to her touch, confirming 
        it responds specifically to Kael.

      status: alive (traveling with Kael)

  current_chapter: 5
  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, is about to be pulled in when an echo-storm reveals something 
    that shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    Now on the run from the Guild with Tam at his side, Kael is crossing the 
    dangerous Rustfields toward Vanthem. The mysterious disk his mother left him 
    grows warmer by the day, and something ancient stirred when he reached for it. 
    Behind them, the Hollow tracks. Ahead, answers wait in a city built from the 
    bones of a dead god.

      summary: "Kael and Tam trek through the Rustfields and shelter at a waystation. The disk responds only to Kael - warm to him, cold to Tam. During his night watch, Kael senses something vast and ancient pulse back through the disk. A flicker in the distance suggests the Hollow is following."
      significance: moderate

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    Kael and Tam spent their first day crossing the Rustfields, navigating through massive 
    rusted debris of the fallen God-Engines. They sheltered at an old waystation - a 
    half-collapsed observation tower used by salvagers for generations.
    
    A troubling discovery: the metal disk his mother left is warm to Kael's touch but cold 
    to Tam's, confirming it responds specifically to him. During his night watch, the disk 
    pulsed like a heartbeat, and Kael felt something vast and ancient pulse back from a 
    great distance.
    
    Kael also spotted a flicker along their back trail as the sun set - possibly the Hollow, 
    still tracking them through the wastelands.
  current_tension_level: 7
  pending_revelations:
    - "The God-Engines are responding to something specific"
    - "Mira didn't dissolve - she went somewhere else"
    - "Why can Kael do things other Tuners can't?"
    - "What is the Hollow, and where did it go?"
    - "What did Kael's parents discover about the God-Engines?"
    - "What is the mysterious metal disk and what does it do?"
    - "What is the ancient presence that responded through the disk?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who found something terrifying"
    - "The disk responds only to Kael - he may be connected to something larger"
    - "An ancient presence answered Kael's unconscious reach - the God-Engines may not be as dead as believed"
    - "The wind in the Rustfields carries whispers - 'Coming'"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "An encounter that forces action - either an echo-storm rolling through (testing Kael's abilities in a dead zone), Changed beasts attacking the waystation, or the Hollow catching up. The ancient presence could offer cryptic guidance. Consider introducing a new character - a fellow traveler or another Tuner on the run."
  characters_involved:
    - Kael Thornwood
    - Tam
  location: "The Rustfields (continuing journey or waystation if attacked)"
  tone: "Rising tension - threats closing in from multiple directions, the disk's mystery deepening"
