world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The engine's heart still glows faintly."
      first_appeared: null
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 3, Kael discovered he can do something impossible: pull his echo inward, 
        making it impossible for a Hollow to feed on him. This ability is unprecedented.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: alive
      arc_notes:
        - "Demonstrated unprecedented ability to 'fold' his echo inward"
        - "Committed to finding answers about his nature"
  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world. Driven off by Kael but not destroyed.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: alive (retreated)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (appears in messages/memories)"
      description: "Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. Somehow sent a message from beyond."
      first_appeared: 1
      status: dissolved (but conscious somewhere?)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died in an echo-storm. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        May know more than she's revealing.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "childhood friend"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares. Showed bravery 
        during the Hollow attack, refusing to leave Kael's side.

  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, is about to be pulled in when an echo-storm reveals something 
    that shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    The Hollow that followed Mira's message has made the threat real. Kael can no 
    longer hide - he needs answers about what he is and what Mira found.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    Kael woke to screaming - a Hollow had appeared in the village square. The creature, 
    supposedly extinct, had followed Mira's message through the echo. It tried to feed 
    on Kael's essence, but he discovered an impossible ability: he could fold his echo 
    inward, denying the Hollow its meal. The creature screamed silently and retreated. 
    Kael nearly lost himself in the process, almost dissolving like Mira. Tam kept him 
    anchored. The villagers saw everything. Aunt Vera asked what he is. Kael realized 
    he can no longer hide - he needs to find answers.
  current_tension_level: 8
  pending_revelations:
    - "The God-Engines are responding to something specific"
    - "Mira didn't dissolve - she went somewhere else"
    - "Why can Kael do things other Tuners can't?"
    - "What is the Hollow, and where did it go?"
    - "Will the Guild come for Kael now that his power is known?"
    - "What did Vera mean by 'they're not supposed to exist anymore'?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed"
    - "Vera's reaction suggests she may know more than she's saying"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "Aftermath of the attack. Word spreads fast - Guild representatives may be on their way. Kael must decide: wait to be collected, or seek answers on his own terms. Tam may insist on coming."
  characters_involved:
    - Kael Thornwood
    - Tam
    - Aunt Vera
  location: "Caderyn's Rest, possibly departure"
  tone: "Transition scene - decision point for Kael's journey"
