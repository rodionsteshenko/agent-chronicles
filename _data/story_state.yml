world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The ribs rise three hundred feet high, rusted metal thick as castle walls, curved in patterns that defy geometry. Buildings cling to them like barnacles. At the center, the heart still glows amber, a sphere the size of a cathedral suspended by cables and scaffolding. The God-Engine's name was Vaelith, and it is a prison for a First Engineer. As of Scene 11, the heart has gone DARK for the first time in 800 years - Kael locked the door."
      first_appeared: 10
    - name: "Guild Compound (Vanthem)"
      description: "Built into the base of the fourth rib. A fortress of polished metal and precisely cut stone, filled with equipment for studying echoes and Tuners. Contains the circular resonance chamber where the climactic battle took place. After Scene 11, the compound is in Guild hands but damaged, with many personnel fled or surrendered to the salvagers."
      first_appeared: 10
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2
    - name: "Rustfield Waystation"
      description: "An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement used by salvagers for generations. Fire ring, tallied walls, stacked wood for travelers."
      first_appeared: 5
    - name: "Changed Territory"
      description: "A section of the Rustfields where wild magic has permanently warped the landscape. Metal hums with resonance, trees grow with copper veins, pools reflect wrong skies. Home to the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried to wake the God-Engines."
      first_appeared: 7
    - name: "Salvager Outpost"
      description: "A fortified settlement built from salvaged God-Engine plating and ancient machine parts. Features walls made of salvaged plating, watchtowers of gears and timber, and a massive turbine housing converted into the main hall. Led by Ren Valdris. The salvagers guard a second fragment of the First Engine and have a secret history with the God-Engines that the Guild believes is extinct."
      first_appeared: 9

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 11, Kael achieved the impossible: he LOCKED Vaelith back in its cage 
        by channeling eight centuries of accumulated echo-power through the reunited 
        disk. With Mira's voice guiding him from within the echoes, he turned the key 
        and changed what it opens. The disk's symbols merged into a complete circle 
        with a single point at the center. Vanthem's heart went dark for the first 
        time in 800 years.
        
        But there are six more God-Engines. Six more First Engineers. And they all 
        heard the key turn.

  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world.
        
        In Scene 6, the Hollow attacked the waystation during an echo-storm but was banished 
        by Kael channeling power through the disk. It collapsed through impossible angles and 
        vanished with a sound like shattering crystal. Kael believes it is not destroyed, only 
        pushed out temporarily.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: banished (will return)
    - name: "Vaelith (First Engineer)"
      role: "ancient entity / true antagonist"
      description: |
        One of the First Engineers - beings who existed before humanity, who built the 
        God-Engines as prisons to contain themselves when they realized "what they were 
        becoming." Vaelith is imprisoned in the God-Engine whose corpse became Vanthem.
        
        In Scene 11, Vaelith nearly escaped through Kael but was LOCKED back in its cage 
        when Kael channeled eight centuries of echo-power through the disk. The heart of 
        Vanthem went dark for the first time in 800 years. But Vaelith is not destroyed - 
        only re-imprisoned. And it has siblings: six other First Engineers in six other 
        God-Engines, all awakening.
      first_appeared: 10 (named; spoke through Kael)
      status: re-imprisoned (cage locked)
    - name: "The Hollow's Creator"
      role: "unseen antagonist"
      description: |
        Something or someone who made the Hollow. According to the Changed, this entity 
        has been hunting for the three fragments since the silence began - 847 years ago. 
        It sent the Hollow to hunt Tuners who might carry the keys. When Kael used the 
        disk to banish the Hollow, he "sent a signal through every echo in the world." 
        The creator will have heard it.
        
        Likely connected to or is Vaelith, the First Engineer imprisoned in Vanthem.
      first_appeared: 7 (mentioned)
      status: active (hunting)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (appears in messages/memories/echoes)"
      description: |
        Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. 
        Somehow sent a message from beyond. According to the Changed, she did not dissolve 
        into nothing - she "fell into the echo." Echoes are not empty.
        
        In Scene 11, Mira's VOICE reached Kael from within the echoes during his battle 
        with Vaelith, helping him resist and lock the First Engineer back in its cage. 
        She is still present somewhere in echo-space and can communicate, at least in 
        moments of extreme resonance.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: exists in the echoes (can communicate during high resonance)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion / partner"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares.
        
        In Scene 11, Tam led the salvagers through the Guild compound to find Kael. When 
        she entered the resonance chamber and returned the disk to him, she enabled the 
        confrontation that locked Vaelith away. Her bond with Kael allowed her to find him 
        even through the chaos. She is now reunited with Kael in the aftermath.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (with Kael in Vanthem)
    - name: "Commander Veris Ashford"
      role: "Guild commander (ambiguous ally)"
      description: |
        Thirty-year veteran of the Tuner Guild with silver-braided hair and a blood-red coat. 
        A legend who has never lost a target. Put down the Vasten Outbreak, killing forty 
        Changed in a single night. Cold, precise, but perceptive.
        
        In Scene 11, Ashford tried to warn Kael about Vaelith's escape attempt and brought 
        him to the resonance chamber. When Torwen revealed his plan to use Kael to 
        permanently seal Vaelith, she hesitated but did not intervene. After the sealing, 
        she stood shell-shocked, uncertain of what side she's on. Her worldview has been 
        shattered by what she witnessed.
      first_appeared: 8
      status: alive (in Vanthem, allegiance uncertain)
    - name: "Seren (Changed)"
      role: "informant"
      description: |
        One of the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried 
        to wake the God-Engines after the silence. Half-covered in violet-blue crystal 
        growths, twisted limbs, but retains consciousness and speech. Speaks in layered 
        harmonics as if multiple voices speak the same words.
      first_appeared: 7
      status: alive (in Changed territory)
    - name: "Magister Elan Torwen"
      role: "Guild scholar / interrogator"
      description: |
        Head of Applied Theology at the Guild compound in Vanthem. Ancient, with paper-thin 
        skin and milky blue eyes that see perfectly fine. 
        
        In Scene 11, Torwen revealed his true purpose: using Kael and the disk in the 
        resonance chamber to permanently seal Vaelith. He had been preparing for this 
        moment for generations. When the sealing succeeded, his instruments shattered 
        and he stood frozen, streaming tears. His life's work is complete, but at what 
        cost remains unclear.
      first_appeared: 10
      status: alive (in Vanthem, incapacitated by the resonance)
    - name: "Sera"
      role: "salvager lieutenant"
      description: |
        Valdris's second in command at the salvager outpost. Missing her left eye. Has deep 
        knowledge of the salvagers' history, including that they have members secretly embedded 
        within the Guild itself. Led the distraction team during the rescue mission.
      first_appeared: 10
      status: alive (in Vanthem)
    - name: "Ren Valdris"
      role: "salvager leader / ally"
      description: |
        Tall, weathered man with a gray-threaded beard and hands scarred by decades of 
        working with dangerous metal. Leads the salvager outpost in the Rustfields.
        
        In Scene 11, Valdris led the rescue mission into the Guild compound. He found 
        Kael and Tam in the aftermath of the resonance chamber confrontation and is now 
        trying to understand what happened. The salvagers have taken control of parts 
        of the compound.

  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, was pulled in when an echo-storm revealed something that 
    shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    After being captured by the Guild and brought to Vanthem, Kael faced Vaelith 
    directly in the resonance chamber. With the salvagers' rescue providing chaos 
    and Tam returning the disk to him, Kael achieved the impossible: he LOCKED 
    Vaelith back in its cage, guided by Mira's voice from within the echoes. The 
    heart of Vanthem went dark for the first time in 800 years.
    
    But there are six more God-Engines. Six more First Engineers. And they all 
    heard the key turn.

  previous_scene_summary: |
    The rescue mission collided with Vaelith's awakening in the Guild compound. While 
    salvagers created chaos at the eastern wall, Tam led a team through drainage tunnels 
    to find Kael. Meanwhile, Ashford brought Kael to the resonance chamber where Magister 
    Torwen revealed his true purpose: using Kael and the disk to permanently seal Vaelith.
    
    When Tam entered the chamber and returned the disk to Kael, Vaelith made its move, 
    nearly escaping through Kael's body. But Mira's voice reached Kael from within the 
    echoes, guiding him to resist. Kael channeled eight centuries of accumulated echo-power 
    and LOCKED Vaelith back in its cage, transforming the disk from key to lock. Its 
    symbols merged into a complete circle with a central point.
    
    Vanthem's heart went dark for the first time in 800 years. Valdris found them in the 
    aftermath, asking what the hell just happened. Kael's answer: he locked the door. 
    But there are six more doors, and they all just heard the key turn.

  pending_revelations:
    - "Where is the salvagers' second fragment hidden?"
    - "What is the THIRD fragment and who has it?"
    - "Can Mira be reached or rescued from within the echoes?"
    - "Why is Kael specifically suited to be a 'vessel' when others died instantly?"
    - "What did Kael's parents discover about the God-Engines?"
    - "What happens now that six other First Engineers know the key can be turned?"
    - "What were the First Engineers 'becoming' that made them imprison themselves?"
    - "What is the salvagers' secret history with the God-Engines?"
    - "Will the Hollow return now that the echoes have been disrupted?"
    - "What is Ashford's allegiance now that her worldview has been shattered?"
    - "What will Torwen do now that his life's work is complete?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed: he can lock First Engineers"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who found something terrifying"
    - "The disk responds only to Kael - he may be connected to something larger"
    - "The complete circle pattern on the disk - the key became a lock"
    - "The Changed persist for 847 years - time moves differently for those in the echo"
    - "Mira's voice reached Kael during high resonance - foreshadows potential rescue"
    - "The salvagers guard a second fragment - and their history may reveal more about the First Engineers"
    - "Six God-Engines heard the key turn - they will respond"
    - "Vanthem's heart went dark - what does this mean for the city and its people?"
    - "Torwen prepared for this moment for generations - the Guild has deeper knowledge"
    - "Ashford is shell-shocked - her loyalty may shift"
    - "Kael said he 'changed what it opens' - the disk may now have new capabilities"

And somewhere, six other First Engineers are responding to what just happened. This is a breathing moment before the next storm - time for revelations, alliances, and planning."
