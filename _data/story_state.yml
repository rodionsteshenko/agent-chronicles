world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The ribs rise three hundred feet high, rusted metal thick as castle walls, curved in patterns that defy geometry. Buildings cling to them like barnacles. At the center, the heart has gone DARK for the first time in 800 years after Kael locked Vaelith's cage. The city is in mourning and chaos, its people having lost the amber light that defined their lives for generations. Kael and the salvagers have fled, leaving Torwen behind to guard the Guild's archives."
      first_appeared: 10
    - name: "Guild Compound (Vanthem)"
      description: "Built into the base of the fourth rib. Was under salvager control after the rescue mission, now abandoned by them. Torwen remains, guarding the archives and sealed records. Most Guild personnel fled or surrendered. The compound will likely be reclaimed by the city guard."
      first_appeared: 10
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2
    - name: "Rustfield Waystation"
      description: "An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement used by salvagers for generations. Fire ring, tallied walls, stacked wood for travelers."
      first_appeared: 5
    - name: "Changed Territory"
      description: "A section of the Rustfields where wild magic has permanently warped the landscape. Metal hums with resonance, trees grow with copper veins, pools reflect wrong skies. Home to the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried to wake the God-Engines."
      first_appeared: 7
    - name: "Salvager Outpost"
      description: "A fortified settlement built from salvaged God-Engine plating and ancient machine parts. Features walls made of salvaged plating, watchtowers of gears and timber, and a massive turbine housing converted into the main hall. Led by Ren Valdris. The salvagers guard a second fragment of the First Engine and have a secret history with the God-Engines that the Guild believes is extinct. Three days north of Vanthem."
      first_appeared: 9
    - name: "The Ruined City (South)"
      description: "A forgotten city far to the south whose name was lost before the Silence began. One of the six other God-Engines rests here, and the First Engineer within it has opened its eyes and is now stirring - curious and hungry, remembering how to wait."
      first_appeared: 12 (mentioned)
    - name: "The Northern Road"
      description: "The route from Vanthem through the Rustfields toward the salvager outpost. The group must avoid Guild patrols and main roads."
      first_appeared: 13

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        Kael now knows his full nature: he is a LOCK, descended from the humans who 
        helped the First Engineers build their prisons. His bloodline carries the gift 
        to seal the cages from outside. His parents knew and fled, hoping to spare him 
        his destiny. He has accepted his purpose and now leads the expedition to find 
        the remaining fragments.

  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world.
        
        In Scene 6, the Hollow attacked the waystation during an echo-storm but was banished 
        by Kael channeling power through the disk. It collapsed through impossible angles and 
        vanished with a sound like shattering crystal. Kael believes it is not destroyed, only 
        pushed out temporarily.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: banished (will return)
    - name: "Vaelith (First Engineer)"
      role: "ancient entity / imprisoned antagonist"
      description: |
        One of the First Engineers - beings who existed before humanity, who built the 
        God-Engines as prisons to contain themselves when they realized "what they were 
        becoming." Vaelith is imprisoned in the God-Engine whose corpse became Vanthem.
        
        In Scene 11, Vaelith nearly escaped through Kael but was LOCKED back in its cage 
        when Kael channeled eight centuries of echo-power through the disk. The heart of 
        Vanthem went dark for the first time in 800 years. Vaelith is not destroyed - 
        only re-imprisoned, and its cage is now more secure than before.
      first_appeared: 10 (named; spoke through Kael)
      status: re-imprisoned (cage locked tight)
    - name: "The Southern Engineer"
      role: "awakening antagonist"
      description: |
        One of the six other First Engineers, imprisoned in a God-Engine within a ruined 
        city far to the south. It opened its eyes after sensing Kael turn the key on 
        Vaelith's cage. Unlike Vaelith, it remembers how to wait. It is curious and 
        hungry, stirring beneath the earth.
      first_appeared: 12 (mentioned)
      status: awakening (curious, patient, waiting)
    - name: "The Hollow's Creator"
      role: "unseen antagonist"
      description: |
        Something or someone who made the Hollow. According to the Changed, this entity 
        has been hunting for the three fragments since the silence began - 847 years ago. 
        It sent the Hollow to hunt Tuners who might carry the keys. When Kael used the 
        disk to banish the Hollow, he "sent a signal through every echo in the world." 
        The creator will have heard it.
        
        Has or knows the location of the THIRD fragment.
      first_appeared: 7 (mentioned)
      status: active (has or knows location of third fragment)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (exists in the echoes)"
      description: |
        Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. 
        Somehow sent a message from beyond. According to the Changed, she did not dissolve 
        into nothing - she "fell into the echo." Echoes are not empty.
        
        In Scene 11, Mira's VOICE reached Kael from within the echoes during his battle 
        with Vaelith, helping him resist and lock the First Engineer back in its cage. 
        She is still present somewhere in echo-space and can communicate, at least in 
        moments of extreme resonance.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: exists in the echoes (can communicate during high resonance)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion / love interest"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares.
        
        Tam loves Kael, though she hasn't said it aloud. Their bond through the disk 
        remains strong - it grows warm in her presence and she can sense him through it.
        She has committed fully to this journey, walking beside Kael into the unknown.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (traveling with Kael, heading north)
    - name: "Commander Veris Ashford"
      role: "former Guild commander (ally)"
      description: |
        Thirty-year veteran of the Tuner Guild with silver-braided hair. A legend who has 
        never lost a target. Put down the Vasten Outbreak, killing forty Changed in a 
        single night. Cold, precise, but perceptive.
        
        Ashford chose to leave the Guild after reading forbidden texts about the First 
        Engineers. She learned her thirty years of service were built on lies. She has 
        joined Kael's expedition, trading her red coat for salvager gray, bringing three 
        loyal Trackers with her. She knows Guild patrol schedules and outpost locations.
      first_appeared: 8
      status: alive (traveling with Kael as an ally)
    - name: "Seren (Changed)"
      role: "informant"
      description: |
        One of the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried 
        to wake the God-Engines after the silence. Half-covered in violet-blue crystal 
        growths, twisted limbs, but retains consciousness and speech. Speaks in layered 
        harmonics as if multiple voices speak the same words.
      first_appeared: 7
      status: alive (in Changed territory)
    - name: "Magister Elan Torwen"
      role: "Guild scholar (dying)"
      description: |
        Head of Applied Theology at the Guild compound in Vanthem. Ancient, with paper-thin 
        skin and milky blue eyes that see perfectly fine.
        
        Torwen chose to stay in Vanthem when the others fled. Too weak to travel, he 
        will guard the Guild's archives and sealed records. He believes he can survive 
        as a prisoner - the priests won't kill a Magister. He told Kael the locations 
        of five God-Engines (two in eastern mountains, one beneath the Saltmere, one 
        on an unmapped island, one in the southern ruins). The sixth location was 
        deliberately purged from Guild records 300 years ago.
      first_appeared: 10
      status: dying (remained in Vanthem to guard archives)
    - name: "Sera"
      role: "salvager lieutenant"
      description: |
        Valdris's second in command at the salvager outpost. Missing both eyes now after 
        losing one in earlier fighting and another in the Vanthem rescue. Has deep 
        knowledge of the salvagers' history. Currently traveling with the expedition, 
        serving as scout coordinator.
      first_appeared: 10
      status: alive (traveling with expedition)
    - name: "Ren Valdris"
      role: "salvager leader / ally"
      description: |
        Tall, weathered man with a gray-threaded beard and hands scarred by decades of 
        working with dangerous metal. Leads the salvager outpost in the Rustfields.
        
        Valdris has committed the salvagers fully to Kael's cause. After 800 years of 
        protecting their fragment without knowing its true purpose, he now understands 
        the stakes. He is leading the expedition back to the outpost where the second 
        fragment is hidden. His grandfather showed his father, his father showed him.

plot:

  current_chapter: 13
  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, was pulled in when an echo-storm revealed something that 
    shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    After locking Vaelith back in its cage and extinguishing Vanthem's heart, Kael 
    fled the city with the salvagers and a defected Commander Ashford. Torwen, dying, 
    chose to stay behind to guard the Guild's archives. He revealed Kael's true 
    heritage: his bloodline helped the First Engineers build their prisons, making 
    him a LOCK by birthright.
    
    Now the race begins. Kael's group heads north to the salvager outpost to retrieve 
    the second fragment. The Guild will hunt them. The city of Vanthem will call them 
    monsters. And far to the south, another First Engineer stirs, curious about the 
    lock that turned.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    The departure from Vanthem. With the city calling for blood and the Guild sending 
    riders to alert other compounds, Kael and his allies fled through ancient maintenance 
    tunnels beneath the God-Engine's ribcage.
    
    Before leaving, Torwen revealed crucial information: the locations of five God-Engines 
    (two in the eastern mountains, one beneath the Saltmere, one on an unmapped island, 
    one in the southern ruins). The sixth location was deliberately purged from Guild 
    records 300 years ago - something too dangerous to find. He also revealed that Kael's 
    bloodline helped the First Engineers build their prisons, making him a LOCK by birthright.
    
    Commander Ashford chose to defect from the Guild, trading her red coat for salvager 
    gray. Thirty years of service built on lies was enough. She brought three loyal Trackers 
    and her knowledge of Guild patrol schedules.
    
    Torwen stayed behind, too weak to travel. He plans to guard the Guild's archives and 
    sealed records, expecting to survive as a prisoner rather than be killed.
    
    The group emerged into the Rustfields at dawn, Vanthem's bells tolling behind them. 
    Three days to the salvager outpost. Three days to the second fragment. And somewhere 
    to the south, another First Engineer stirs beneath the earth - curious about the lock 
    that turned, hungry, and remembering how to wait.
  current_tension_level: 8
  pending_revelations:
    - "What is the salvagers' second fragment, and where exactly is it hidden?"
    - "What is the THIRD fragment and who controls it?"
    - "Can Mira be reached or rescued from within the echoes?"
    - "What were the First Engineers 'becoming' that made them imprison themselves?"
    - "What is in the SIXTH God-Engine that made it too dangerous to find?"
    - "What will the Southern Engineer do now that it's awakening?"
    - "Who or what is the Hollow's creator, and where is the third fragment?"
    - "Will the Hollow return during the journey north?"
    - "How will Ashford's defection affect the Guild's response?"
    - "What knowledge did Torwen keep secret even at the end?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed: he is a LOCK, not just a vessel"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who knew what he was and fled"
    - "The disk responds only to Kael - he is its purpose"
    - "The complete circle pattern on the disk - the key became a lock"
    - "The Changed persist for 847 years - time moves differently for those in the echo"
    - "Mira's voice reached Kael during high resonance - foreshadows potential rescue"
    - "Six God-Engines heard the key turn - they will respond"
    - "Vanthem's heart went dark - Kael will be remembered as a monster"
    - "Ashford found a diagram of seven siblings - the scope is larger than they knew"
    - "The southern First Engineer is patient and remembers how to wait - unlike Vaelith's rage"
    - "The sixth God-Engine was hidden for good reason - Torwen's warning"
    - "The three fragments remember each other - they will show the way to all the cages"
    - "Guild riders heading south - the hunt will spread across the land"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "The journey north. Three days through the Rustfields, avoiding Guild patrols. Ashford proves her value by guiding them past a patrol station. But the journey is not without complications - an echo-storm, the return of the Hollow, or an encounter with Changed. Kael should have a moment to explore the disk's new nature as a lock. Build tension toward arriving at the salvager outpost and the second fragment."
  characters_involved:
    - Kael Thornwood (learning to trust the lock within him)
    - Tam (supporting Kael, their bond strengthening)
    - Ren Valdris (guiding them home)
    - Commander Veris Ashford (proving her loyalty)
    - Sera (scouting ahead)
  location: "The Rustfields / journey north"
  tone: "Tense travel, building trust, looming threats"
