world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The engine's heart still glows faintly."

    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.

      status: dead
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died in an echo-storm. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.

    - name: "Tam"
      role: "childhood friend"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares.

  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, is about to be pulled in when an echo-storm reveals something 
    that shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    Kael returned to Caderyn's Rest shaken by Mira's message. He deflected questions from 
    his friend Tam and confided in Aunt Vera about hearing Mira in the echo-storm. Vera 
    urged him to tell the Tuner's Guild, but Kael refused, fearing they would study and 
    use him. He retreated to his room, haunted by his sister's warning that "something 
    followed her" and unsure what to do next.
  current_tension_level: 7
  pending_revelations:
    - "The God-Engines are responding to something specific"
    - "Mira didn't dissolve - she went somewhere else"
    - "Kael's power is different from other Tuners"
    - "What followed Mira back?"
    - "Why did the echo seem addressed specifically to Kael?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael suspects he can do things other Tuners can't"
    - "Vera's reaction suggests she may know more than she's saying"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "Something arrives in Caderyn's Rest - the 'something' that followed Mira? Or a Guild representative drawn by the unusual echo activity?"
  characters_involved:
    - Kael Thornwood
    - Tam
  location: "Caderyn's Rest"
  tone: "Tension escalates, inciting incident forces Kael to act"
