world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The engine's heart still glows faintly."
      first_appeared: null
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2
    - name: "Rustfield Waystation"
      description: "An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement used by salvagers for generations. Fire ring, tallied walls, stacked wood for travelers."
      first_appeared: 5

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 3, Kael discovered he can do something impossible: pull his echo inward, 
        making it impossible for a Hollow to feed on him. This ability is unprecedented.
        
        In Scene 4, Kael learned his parents were researchers who studied the God-Engines 
        and found something that scared them into hiding. He now carries a mysterious 
        metal disk his mother left behind.
        
        In Scene 6, Kael discovered the disk can channel wild magic even in dead zones. 
        An ancient voice spoke through him to banish the Hollow. The disk's symbols 
        changed afterward, forming a pattern: a circle broken into three segments.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: alive
      arc_notes:
        - "Demonstrated unprecedented ability to 'fold' his echo inward"
        - "Committed to finding answers about his nature"
        - "Received mysterious metal disk from his parents (via Vera)"
        - "Departed for Vanthem with Tam"
        - "Disk responds only to him - may be keyed to his unique nature"
        - "Felt a distant, ancient presence respond through the disk"
        - "Channeled wild storm magic through the disk to banish the Hollow"
        - "An ancient voice spoke through him - 'BEGONE'"
        - "The disk's symbols reformed into a broken circle pattern"
  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world.
        
        In Scene 6, the Hollow attacked the waystation during an echo-storm but was banished 
        by Kael channeling power through the disk. It collapsed through impossible angles and 
        vanished with a sound like shattering crystal. Kael believes it is not destroyed, only 
        pushed out temporarily.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: banished (will return)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (appears in messages/memories)"
      description: "Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. Somehow sent a message from beyond."
      first_appeared: 1
      status: dissolved (but conscious somewhere?)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares.
        
        In Scene 6, Tam revealed that her mother drowned when she was eight, pushing her to 
        shore before the current took her. She decided after Mira's dissolution that she was 
        done being afraid. Refuses to leave Kael despite the danger.

      status: alive (traveling with Kael)

  current_chapter: 6
  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, is about to be pulled in when an echo-storm reveals something 
    that shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    Now on the run from the Guild with Tam at his side, Kael has survived a Hollow 
    attack by channeling an echo-storm through his mother's disk. An ancient voice 
    spoke through him, claiming he carries "a piece" of something vast and old. 
    The God-Engines, it seems, are not as dead as everyone believes.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    The Hollow caught up to Kael and Tam at the waystation, attacking during a sudden 
    echo-storm. In the dead zone of the Rustfields, Kael had no echo to tune - but the 
    disk pulled in the storm's wild magic and channeled it through him.
    
    An ancient voice, the same one from his dreams, spoke through Kael: "BEGONE." The 
    Hollow was banished, collapsing through impossible angles with a sound like shattering 
    crystal. Kael believes it will return.
    
    After the battle, Tam revealed her mother drowned when she was eight, pushing her to 
    safety. She decided after watching Mira dissolve that she was done being afraid. She 
    refuses to leave Kael despite the danger.
    
    The disk's symbols have changed, forming a new pattern: a circle broken into three 
    segments. Kael suspects the disk is a literal piece of a God-Engine - and that the 
    God-Engines are not as dead as everyone believes.
  current_tension_level: 8
  pending_revelations:
    - "The God-Engines are responding to something specific"
    - "Mira didn't dissolve - she went somewhere else"
    - "Why can Kael do things other Tuners can't?"
    - "What did Kael's parents discover about the God-Engines?"
    - "What is the ancient presence that speaks through the disk?"
    - "What does the broken circle symbol mean?"
    - "Why did the Hollow follow Mira's message specifically?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who found something terrifying"
    - "The disk responds only to Kael - he may be connected to something larger"
    - "An ancient presence answered Kael's unconscious reach - the God-Engines may not be as dead as believed"
    - "The voice said 'you carry a piece of me' - the disk is literally part of a God-Engine"
    - "The broken circle pattern on the disk - significance unknown"
    - "Salvager's map shows 'Changed territory' and 'Guild outpost' ahead"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "The journey continues through the Rustfields. Consider: encountering Changed creatures, meeting other travelers (possible ally or threat?), or reaching a danger point marked on the salvager's map. Could also explore Kael and Tam's deepening bond and his processing of what the ancient voice said. The Guild pursuit is closing in."
  characters_involved:
    - Kael Thornwood
    - Tam
  location: "The Rustfields (continuing journey toward Vanthem)"
  tone: "Brief respite with growing dread - the threats multiply but so does understanding"
