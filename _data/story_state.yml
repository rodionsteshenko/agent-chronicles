world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The engine's heart still glows faintly."
      first_appeared: null
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2
    - name: "Rustfield Waystation"
      description: "An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement used by salvagers for generations. Fire ring, tallied walls, stacked wood for travelers."
      first_appeared: 5
    - name: "Changed Territory"
      description: "A section of the Rustfields where wild magic has permanently warped the landscape. Metal hums with resonance, trees grow with copper veins, pools reflect wrong skies. Home to the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried to wake the God-Engines."
      first_appeared: 7
    - name: "Salvager Outpost"
      description: "A fortified settlement built from salvaged God-Engine plating and ancient machine parts. Features walls made of salvaged plating, watchtowers of gears and timber, and a massive turbine housing converted into the main hall. Led by Ren Valdris. The salvagers guard a second fragment of the First Engine and have a secret history with the God-Engines that the Guild believes is extinct."
      first_appeared: 9

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 3, Kael discovered he can do something impossible: pull his echo inward, 
        making it impossible for a Hollow to feed on him. This ability is unprecedented.
        
        In Scene 4, Kael learned his parents were researchers who studied the God-Engines 
        and found something that scared them into hiding. He now carries a mysterious 
        metal disk his mother left behind.
        
        In Scene 6, Kael discovered the disk can channel wild magic even in dead zones. 
        An ancient voice spoke through him to banish the Hollow. The disk's symbols 
        changed afterward, forming a pattern: a circle broken into three segments.
        
        In Scene 7, Kael learned from the Changed that he is a "vessel" the God-Engine 
        is trying to fill - not a Tuner reaching for power, but power reaching for him. 
        He also learned that Mira may not be truly gone: "She fell into the echo."

  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world.
        
        In Scene 6, the Hollow attacked the waystation during an echo-storm but was banished 
        by Kael channeling power through the disk. It collapsed through impossible angles and 
        vanished with a sound like shattering crystal. Kael believes it is not destroyed, only 
        pushed out temporarily.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: banished (will return)
    - name: "The Hollow's Creator"
      role: "unseen antagonist"
      description: |
        Something or someone who made the Hollow. According to the Changed, this entity 
        has been hunting for the three fragments since the silence began - 847 years ago. 
        It sent the Hollow to hunt Tuners who might carry the keys. When Kael used the 
        disk to banish the Hollow, he "sent a signal through every echo in the world." 
        The creator will have heard it.
      first_appeared: 7 (mentioned)
      status: active (hunting)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (appears in messages/memories)"
      description: |
        Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. 
        Somehow sent a message from beyond. According to the Changed, she did not dissolve 
        into nothing - she "fell into the echo." Echoes are not empty. This suggests Mira 
        may still exist somewhere within the echo-space.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: dissolved (but exists in the echoes - can potentially be found)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion / disk bearer"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares.
        
        In Scene 6, Tam revealed that her mother drowned when she was eight, pushing her to 
        shore before the current took her. She decided after Mira's dissolution that she was 
        done being afraid. Refuses to leave Kael despite the danger.
        
        In Scene 8, Kael surrendered to the Guild to allow Tam to escape. He entrusted her 
        with the disk - the first fragment.
        
        In Scene 9, Tam reached the salvager outpost and met Ren Valdris. She learned that 
        the salvagers guard a SECOND fragment and are planning a rescue mission to free Kael 
        from the Guild. The disk went cold when Kael surrendered, as if mourning. Despite 
        exhaustion and fear, she completed her mission and is now allied with potential 
        rescuers.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (at salvager outpost with the disk)
    - name: "Commander Veris Ashford"
      role: "Guild antagonist (potential ally?)"
      description: |
        Thirty-year veteran of the Tuner Guild with silver-braided hair and a blood-red coat. 
        A legend who has never lost a target. Put down the Vasten Outbreak, killing forty 
        Changed in a single night. Cold, precise, but perceptive. Recognized that Kael is 
        something unprecedented and more valuable alive than dissected. Respects strength 
        even in enemies. Allowed Tam to escape as part of Kael's surrender terms.
        
        In Scene 9, Ashford revealed that Kael is "not the first" vessel in 800 years, 
        but he's "the first who might survive." She knows more than she's said, and 
        showed genuine worry when Kael demonstrated his shackles don't fully contain him.
      first_appeared: 8
      status: alive (transporting Kael to Vanthem)
    - name: "Seren (Changed)"
      role: "informant"
      description: |
        One of the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried 
        to wake the God-Engines after the silence. Half-covered in violet-blue crystal 
        growths, twisted limbs, but retains consciousness and speech. Speaks in layered 
        harmonics as if multiple voices speak the same words. 
        
        Delivered crucial information to Kael: the disk is one of three fragments from 
        the "First Engine," Kael is a "vessel" the God-Engine is trying to fill, Mira 
        fell into the echoes rather than dissolving, and something ancient made the 
        Hollow to hunt for the fragments.
      first_appeared: 7
      status: alive (in Changed territory)
    - name: "Ren Valdris"
      role: "salvager leader / potential ally"
      description: |
        Tall, weathered man with a gray-threaded beard and hands scarred by decades of 
        working with dangerous metal. Leads the salvager outpost in the Rustfields. 
        Moves like someone who's seen combat.
        
        Revealed that his people have been guarding ANOTHER fragment of the First Engine 
        for generations, hidden somewhere the Guild has never found. He identified Kael's 
        disk as "the Key" - the circle that holds. Has people in Vanthem and is planning 
        a rescue mission for Kael. Hinted that Ashford thinks some group is "extinct" - 
        the salvagers may have a secret history with the God-Engines.

  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, is about to be pulled in when an echo-storm reveals something 
    that shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    Now on the run from the Guild with Tam at his side, Kael has learned the truth 
    from the Changed: his disk is one of three fragments from the First Engine, and 
    he is not a Tuner reaching for power - he is a vessel that power is reaching for. 
    His sister Mira did not dissolve but fell into the echoes, and may still exist. 
    But an ancient enemy has been hunting the fragments for 847 years, and Kael's 
    use of the disk has revealed his location to every echo in the world.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    The story split into parallel tracks. Tam reached the salvager outpost after a grueling 
    trek across the Rustfields. There she met Ren Valdris, a grizzled leader whose people 
    have been guarding a SECOND fragment of the First Engine for generations. The salvagers 
    identified Kael's disk as "the Key" and revealed they have people in Vanthem - they're 
    planning a rescue mission.
    
    Meanwhile, Kael traveled south in a Guild transport wagon with Commander Ashford. When 
    he revealed that his echo-shackles were useless against him, Ashford dropped a bombshell: 
    Kael is "not the first" vessel in 800 years, but he's "the first who might survive." 
    The Guild knows more about the God-Engines than they've ever admitted.
    
    As the scene closed, Kael sensed a thin connection to the disk across the distance - 
    and knew that Tam was still fighting.
  current_tension_level: 8
  pending_revelations:
    - "Where is the salvagers' second fragment hidden?"
    - "What is the THIRD fragment and who has it?"
    - "Who or what created the Hollow and hunts the fragments?"
    - "Can Mira be found or reached within the echoes?"
    - "Why is Kael specifically suited to be a 'vessel'?"
    - "What did Kael's parents discover about the God-Engines?"
    - "What happens when the three fragments are reunited?"
    - "Who is 'the Architect' who shattered the First Engine?"
    - "What happened to previous vessels? Why didn't they survive?"
    - "What is the salvagers' secret history with the God-Engines?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who found something terrifying"
    - "The disk responds only to Kael - he may be connected to something larger"
    - "An ancient presence answered Kael's unconscious reach - the God-Engines may not be as dead as believed"
    - "The voice said 'you carry a piece of me' - the disk is literally part of a God-Engine"
    - "The broken circle pattern on the disk - one of three fragments"
    - "The Changed persist for 847 years - time moves differently for those in the echo"
    - "Mira 'fell into the echo' - foreshadows potential reunion"
    - "Something ancient hunts the fragments - has been hunting since the silence began"
    - "Kael's signal went through 'every echo in the world' - consequences coming"
    - "Kael still feels warmth in his chest without the disk - the connection is internal"
    - "Ashford wants Kael studied, not dissected - the Guild may have deeper knowledge"
    - "Kael is 'not the first' vessel - previous attempts failed"
    - "The salvagers guard a second fragment - and think the Guild considers them extinct"
    - "Kael and the disk remain connected across distance - vessel bond transcends proximity"
