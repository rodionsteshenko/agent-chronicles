world:
  name: "The Shattered Accord"
  era: "The Third Silence - 847 years after the God-Engines fell"
  description: |
    A world where magic once flowed through massive mechanical constructs called God-Engines, 
    built by a civilization now lost. When they fell silent, magic fractured - now it exists 
    only in "echoes," unstable pockets that drift across the land like storms. Those who 
    can read the echoes and harvest their power are called Tuners. Most die young.
    
    The great cities built around dormant God-Engines have become religious sites, 
    their priests claiming the machines will wake again. The wilds between cities 
    are dangerous, riddled with echo-storms and the Changed - creatures and people 
    warped by unstable magic.
  locations:
    - name: "Vanthem"
      description: "A city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The ribs rise three hundred feet high, rusted metal thick as castle walls, curved in patterns that defy geometry. Buildings cling to them like barnacles. At the center, the heart has gone DARK for the first time in 800 years after Kael locked Vaelith's cage. The city is in mourning and chaos, its people having lost the amber light that defined their lives for generations."
      first_appeared: 10
    - name: "Guild Compound (Vanthem)"
      description: "Built into the base of the fourth rib. Now under salvager control after the rescue mission. Contains the resonance chamber where Kael locked Vaelith away. Many Guild personnel fled or surrendered. Commander Ashford remains, uncertain of her loyalties. Magister Torwen is in the infirmary, barely alive but still speaking."
      first_appeared: 10
    - name: "The Rustfields"
      description: "Plains littered with ancient machine debris, dangerous echo-storms roll through weekly."
      first_appeared: 1
    - name: "Caderyn's Rest"
      description: "A remote village at the edge of the Rustfields, known for producing Tuners. Features a massive gear as its gate."
      first_appeared: 2
    - name: "Rustfield Waystation"
      description: "An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement used by salvagers for generations. Fire ring, tallied walls, stacked wood for travelers."
      first_appeared: 5
    - name: "Changed Territory"
      description: "A section of the Rustfields where wild magic has permanently warped the landscape. Metal hums with resonance, trees grow with copper veins, pools reflect wrong skies. Home to the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried to wake the God-Engines."
      first_appeared: 7
    - name: "Salvager Outpost"
      description: "A fortified settlement built from salvaged God-Engine plating and ancient machine parts. Features walls made of salvaged plating, watchtowers of gears and timber, and a massive turbine housing converted into the main hall. Led by Ren Valdris. The salvagers guard a second fragment of the First Engine and have a secret history with the God-Engines that the Guild believes is extinct."
      first_appeared: 9
    - name: "The Ruined City (South)"
      description: "A forgotten city far to the south whose name was lost before the Silence began. One of the six other God-Engines rests here, and the First Engineer within it has just opened its eyes after sensing the key turn."
      first_appeared: 12 (mentioned)

magic_system:
  name: "Echo-Tuning"
  description: |
    Magic exists in unstable pockets called "echoes" - remnants of the God-Engines' power.
    Tuners can sense echoes, attune to them, and channel their energy. But echoes are 
    unpredictable. Use too much, too fast, and the Tuner risks "dissolution" - their 
    body and mind fragmenting like the magic itself. Most Tuners burn out by 30.
  costs: "Physical deterioration, memory fragmentation, eventual dissolution"
  limits: "Must be near an echo source, power is unstable and hard to control"

characters:
  protagonists:
    - name: "Kael Thornwood"
      role: protagonist
      description: |
        A 23-year-old Tuner from Caderyn's Rest, one of the strongest in a generation - 
        and terrified of his own power. His older sister Mira dissolved three years ago 
        after pushing too hard during an echo-storm. Kael has been running from his 
        abilities ever since, working as a courier rather than joining the Tuner guilds.
        
        Cynical, guarded, but deeply loyal to the few people he lets close. Uses humor 
        to deflect. Haunted by the moment he watched his sister fade.
        
        In Scene 12, Kael learned more about his nature from the dying Torwen: he is 
        not just a vessel but a LOCK - someone with the purpose to seal the First 
        Engineers away. His parents knew what he was and fled with him hoping to escape 
        his destiny. He now understands that the other six First Engineers will test him, 
        trying to break their own cages. He and the salvagers plan to find the remaining 
        fragments before their enemies do.

  antagonists:
    - name: "The Hollow"
      role: "recurring threat"
      description: |
        A creature that crossed through an echo and came back wrong. Translucent like clouded 
        glass, with a featureless smooth face. Moves in stuttering, skip-frame motion. Hunts 
        Tuners to feed on their echo essence. Supposedly extinct, but this one followed Mira's 
        message back to the physical world.
        
        In Scene 6, the Hollow attacked the waystation during an echo-storm but was banished 
        by Kael channeling power through the disk. It collapsed through impossible angles and 
        vanished with a sound like shattering crystal. Kael believes it is not destroyed, only 
        pushed out temporarily.
      first_appeared: 3
      status: banished (will return)
    - name: "Vaelith (First Engineer)"
      role: "ancient entity / true antagonist"
      description: |
        One of the First Engineers - beings who existed before humanity, who built the 
        God-Engines as prisons to contain themselves when they realized "what they were 
        becoming." Vaelith is imprisoned in the God-Engine whose corpse became Vanthem.
        
        In Scene 11, Vaelith nearly escaped through Kael but was LOCKED back in its cage 
        when Kael channeled eight centuries of echo-power through the disk. The heart of 
        Vanthem went dark for the first time in 800 years. But Vaelith is not destroyed - 
        only re-imprisoned. And it has siblings: six other First Engineers in six other 
        God-Engines, all awakening.
      first_appeared: 10 (named; spoke through Kael)
      status: re-imprisoned (cage locked)
    - name: "The Southern Engineer"
      role: "awakening antagonist"
      description: |
        One of the six other First Engineers, imprisoned in a God-Engine within a ruined 
        city far to the south. It opened its eyes at the end of Scene 12 after sensing 
        Kael turn the key on Vaelith's cage.
      first_appeared: 12 (mentioned)
      status: awakening
    - name: "The Hollow's Creator"
      role: "unseen antagonist"
      description: |
        Something or someone who made the Hollow. According to the Changed, this entity 
        has been hunting for the three fragments since the silence began - 847 years ago. 
        It sent the Hollow to hunt Tuners who might carry the keys. When Kael used the 
        disk to banish the Hollow, he "sent a signal through every echo in the world." 
        The creator will have heard it.
        
        Likely has or knows the location of the THIRD fragment.
      first_appeared: 7 (mentioned)
      status: active (has or knows location of third fragment)
  supporting:
    - name: "Mira Thornwood"
      role: "deceased sister (exists in the echoes)"
      description: |
        Kael's older sister, a brilliant Tuner who pushed too far. Her dissolution haunts him. 
        Somehow sent a message from beyond. According to the Changed, she did not dissolve 
        into nothing - she "fell into the echo." Echoes are not empty.
        
        In Scene 11, Mira's VOICE reached Kael from within the echoes during his battle 
        with Vaelith, helping him resist and lock the First Engineer back in its cage. 
        She is still present somewhere in echo-space and can communicate, at least in 
        moments of extreme resonance.
      first_appeared: 1
      status: exists in the echoes (can communicate during high resonance)
    - name: "Aunt Vera"
      role: "guardian"
      description: |
        Kael's aunt who raised him and Mira after their parents died. 
        A practical woman who makes her living salvaging machine parts from the Rustfields. 
        Fiercely protective of Kael, having already lost Mira. No Tuning ability herself.
        
        Revealed in Scene 4: She knows more than she let on. Kael's parents were researchers 
        who studied the God-Engines, found something frightening, and fled to raise their 
        children in obscurity. She gave Kael a mysterious metal disk his mother left behind.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (remained in Caderyn's Rest)
    - name: "Tam"
      role: "traveling companion / love interest"
      description: |
        Sharp-tongued and observant, Tam is one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who 
        treats Kael normally. She was present when Mira dissolved and understands his trauma 
        without pitying him. Uses sarcasm as a shield, but genuinely cares.
        
        In Scene 12, Tam waited outside the infirmary while Kael spoke with Torwen. She 
        realized she loves Kael, though she hasn't said it aloud. Their bond through the 
        disk remains strong - it grows warm in her presence and she can sense him through it.
      first_appeared: 2
      status: alive (with Kael in Vanthem)
    - name: "Commander Veris Ashford"
      role: "Guild commander (conflicted)"
      description: |
        Thirty-year veteran of the Tuner Guild with silver-braided hair and a blood-red coat. 
        A legend who has never lost a target. Put down the Vasten Outbreak, killing forty 
        Changed in a single night. Cold, precise, but perceptive.
        
        In Scene 12, Ashford chose to stay in the compound rather than flee with other 
        Guild members. She spent the night alone in Torwen's study, reading forbidden books 
        and learning about the true nature of the First Engineers. She discovered a diagram 
        showing seven figures - siblings - connected by lines of power. Her certainty has 
        been shattered; her future allegiance remains uncertain.
      first_appeared: 8
      status: alive (in Vanthem, allegiance uncertain, reading forbidden Guild texts)
    - name: "Seren (Changed)"
      role: "informant"
      description: |
        One of the Changed - Tuners who were transformed 847 years ago when they tried 
        to wake the God-Engines after the silence. Half-covered in violet-blue crystal 
        growths, twisted limbs, but retains consciousness and speech. Speaks in layered 
        harmonics as if multiple voices speak the same words.
      first_appeared: 7
      status: alive (in Changed territory)
    - name: "Magister Elan Torwen"
      role: "Guild scholar (dying)"
      description: |
        Head of Applied Theology at the Guild compound in Vanthem. Ancient, with paper-thin 
        skin and milky blue eyes that see perfectly fine.
        
        In Scene 12, Torwen revealed more to Kael: that Kael is a LOCK, not just a vessel, 
        with a purpose to seal the First Engineers. His family has served the Guild for 
        300 years waiting for someone like Kael. He told Kael that his parents knew what 
        he was and fled trying to escape his destiny. Torwen is now barely alive, his body 
        damaged beyond what healers can repair. His knowledge may be crucial going forward.
      first_appeared: 10
      status: dying (in infirmary, still has knowledge to share)
    - name: "Sera"
      role: "salvager lieutenant"
      description: |
        Valdris's second in command at the salvager outpost. Missing her left eye. Has deep 
        knowledge of the salvagers' history, including that they have members secretly embedded 
        within the Guild itself. Led the distraction team during the rescue mission.
        
        In Scene 12, she reported to Valdris about Torwen awakening, now wearing a fresh 
        bandage over her missing eye after losing another in the fighting.
      first_appeared: 10
      status: alive (in Vanthem)
    - name: "Ren Valdris"
      role: "salvager leader / ally"
      description: |
        Tall, weathered man with a gray-threaded beard and hands scarred by decades of 
        working with dangerous metal. Leads the salvager outpost in the Rustfields.
        
        In Scene 12, Valdris committed the salvagers fully to Kael's cause. After 800 
        years of protecting their fragment without knowing its true purpose, he now 
        understands the stakes. He plans to move soon before the Guild can regroup or 
        the city guard mobilizes against them.
      first_appeared: 9
      status: alive (in Vanthem, allied with Kael)

plot:
  current_act: 2  # 1=setup, 2=confrontation, 3=resolution
  current_chapter: 12
  arc_summary: |
    Something is waking the God-Engines. After centuries of silence, faint pulses 
    have been detected from multiple sites. The Tuner guilds are mobilizing. The 
    priests are calling it prophecy fulfilled. And Kael, who wants nothing to do 
    with any of it, was pulled in when an echo-storm revealed something that 
    shouldn't exist - a message from his dead sister.
    
    After being captured by the Guild and brought to Vanthem, Kael faced Vaelith 
    directly in the resonance chamber. With the salvagers' rescue providing chaos 
    and Tam returning the disk to him, Kael achieved the impossible: he LOCKED 
    Vaelith back in its cage, guided by Mira's voice from within the echoes. The 
    heart of Vanthem went dark for the first time in 800 years.
    
    Now the aftermath unfolds. Vanthem grieves the loss of its eternal light. The 
    salvagers control the Guild compound. Torwen, dying, has revealed that Kael 
    is not just a vessel but a LOCK - with the purpose to seal the First Engineers. 
    Far to the south, another First Engineer opens its eyes. There are six more 
    God-Engines, six more cages, and they all heard the key turn.

narrative:
  previous_scene_summary: |
    The aftermath of Vaelith's imprisonment. Vanthem woke to darkness for the first time 
    in 800 years, the city in grief as the God-Engine's amber heart went cold. The salvagers 
    now control the Guild compound; most Guild members fled or surrendered.
    
    Commander Ashford chose to stay, spending the night reading forbidden books in Torwen's 
    study. She found a diagram of seven connected figures - siblings - and begins to 
    understand the true scope of what they face.
    
    Magister Torwen, barely alive in the infirmary, revealed crucial information to Kael: 
    he is not just a vessel but a LOCK, someone with the purpose to seal the First Engineers. 
    His family served the Guild for 300 years waiting for someone like him. His parents 
    knew what he was and fled, hoping to escape his destiny.
    
    Tam waited and realized she loves Kael. Valdris committed the salvagers fully to Kael's 
    cause after 800 years of protecting their fragment without understanding its true purpose.
    
    As dawn broke over a city mourning its lost light, Kael and Valdris agreed to move soon - 
    to find the remaining fragments before their enemies do. Far to the south, in a ruined 
    city whose name was forgotten before the Silence, another First Engineer opened its eyes.
  current_tension_level: 7
  pending_revelations:
    - "Where exactly is the salvagers' second fragment hidden?"
    - "What is the THIRD fragment and who controls it?"
    - "Can Mira be reached or rescued from within the echoes?"
    - "What did Kael's parents discover about the God-Engines before they fled?"
    - "What were the First Engineers 'becoming' that made them imprison themselves?"
    - "How will the other six First Engineers respond to the key turning?"
    - "Will Ashford join Kael's cause or return to the Guild?"
    - "What knowledge does the dying Torwen still hold?"
    - "Who or what is the Hollow's creator, and where is the third fragment?"
    - "What will the people of Vanthem do now that their god has gone dark?"
  foreshadowing:
    - "The echo was structured, like a message - implies someone can shape echoes deliberately"
    - "Mira's dissolution happened while she was 'reaching for something only she could see'"
    - "Kael can do things other Tuners cannot - confirmed: he is a LOCK, not just a vessel"
    - "Hollows being 'extinct' implies someone or something eliminated them before"
    - "Kael's parents were God-Engine researchers who knew what he was and fled"
    - "The disk responds only to Kael - he is its purpose"
    - "The complete circle pattern on the disk - the key became a lock"
    - "The Changed persist for 847 years - time moves differently for those in the echo"
    - "Mira's voice reached Kael during high resonance - foreshadows potential rescue"
    - "The salvagers guard a second fragment - they will need to retrieve it"
    - "Six God-Engines heard the key turn - they will respond"
    - "Vanthem's heart went dark - the city will change, perhaps turn against them"
    - "Torwen prepared for this moment for generations - the Guild has deeper knowledge"
    - "Ashford found a diagram of seven siblings - the scope is larger than they knew"
    - "The southern First Engineer opened its eyes - the race has begun"
    - "Tam loves Kael - this bond may be tested"
    - "Torwen is dying but still has knowledge - time is running out to learn from him"

next_scene:
  suggested_focus: "The departure. Kael, Tam, and the salvagers must leave Vanthem before the city turns against them. They need to reach the salvager outpost and retrieve the second fragment. But they should extract more knowledge from Torwen first, and deal with Ashford - will she come with them or stay? The journey will not be easy; word of the heart's darkness will spread, and the Guild will be hunting them. Meanwhile, the southern First Engineer is stirring."
