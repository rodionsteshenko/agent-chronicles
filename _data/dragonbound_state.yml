  # STYLE RULES (from Rodion's feedback)
  style:
    - "ACTION over dialogue - show things happening, not people talking about them"
    - "BIG time jumps - each chapter can skip hours, days, or weeks"
    - "PLOT PROGRESSION - something significant must happen each chapter"
    - "Minimize exposition dumps and lengthy conversations"
    - "Adventure pace - think montages, journeys, discoveries"
    - "2 chapters/day means each one needs to MOVE the story"
