The city woke to darkness.

Not the darkness of night, which Vanthem knew well. This was something older. For eight hundred years, the God-Engine's heart had glowed amber through every hour, a constant warmth that seeped into stone and skin and soul. The people of Vanthem had built their lives around that light. Children learned to read by it. Lovers met beneath it. The dying turned their faces toward it in their final moments.

Now it was gone.

Kael stood at the window of the resonance chamber, looking out over a city in chaos. Torches flickered to life in windows and streets, inadequate and afraid. Somewhere in the distance, a woman was screaming. Bells were ringing from the Temple of the Slumbering God, their tones frantic and confused.

"They're panicking," Tam said, coming to stand beside him. Her hand found his and held tight. "They don't understand what happened."

"Neither do I." Kael looked down at the disk in his other hand. The new pattern gleamed faintly, catching the torchlight from below. A complete circle. A closed door. "I know what I did. I just don't know what it means."

Behind them, Valdris was directing his people with quiet efficiency. The Guild compound was theirs now, or most of it. The survivors had surrendered or fled into the city. A few had simply stood down, stripping off their insignia and walking away. Thirty years of certainty, Ashford had called it. Thirty years of believing the God-Engines would wake again and everything would be made right.

Now one of them had gone dark, and certainty was a luxury no one could afford.

Commander Veris Ashford sat alone in Torwen's study, surrounded by books she'd never been allowed to read.

The Magister himself was unconscious in the infirmary, his ancient body finally betraying him. The healers said he would live, though they couldn't say what would be left of him when he woke. The resonance had burned through his instruments and, apparently, through something in his mind as well.

Ashford had been given the choice to flee with the others. She'd stayed.

She didn't know why. Duty, perhaps, though duty to what? The Guild that had lied to her for three decades? The boy who had done the impossible? The city that was even now tearing itself apart outside these walls?

Or maybe she stayed because running felt like admitting that everything she'd believed was wrong.

*You're not the first*, she'd told Kael on the journey here. *But you might be the first who survives.*

She hadn't known the half of it.

The books on Torwen's shelves were old. Older than the Guild, older than Vanthem, older perhaps than the Third Silence itself. She pulled one down at random and found pages covered in symbols that hurt to look at, diagrams of things that couldn't exist.

One page showed seven figures arranged in a circle, each one connected to the others by lines of power. Beneath them, a single word in a language Ashford didn't recognize.

But she could guess what it meant.

*Siblings.*

"We need to move."

Valdris's voice cut through Kael's contemplation. The salvager leader looked exhausted, his gray-threaded beard matted with dust and sweat, but his eyes were sharp.

"The city guard will mobilize once they get over the shock. We have maybe two hours before someone decides we're responsible for—" He gestured vaguely at the window, at the darkness, at everything.

"Aren't we?" Tam asked quietly.

"We came to rescue a prisoner. Whatever happened in that chamber, that's between him and things older than any of us." Valdris fixed his gaze on Kael. "Speaking of which. What exactly did happen?"

Kael turned from the window. In the torchlight, the lines of exhaustion on his face made him look older than twenty-three. Older than his aunt, than Valdris, than perhaps anyone living.

"Vaelith tried to escape through me. It's been trying since the moment I touched the disk, maybe since I was born. The First Engineers built their cages, but they left doors. Keys." He lifted the disk. "This was supposed to be a piece of the key that opens them. Instead, I turned it into a lock."

"How?"

"I don't know. Mira showed me. She's—" His voice caught. "She's still in there. In the echoes. She never dissolved. She just fell deeper than anyone's ever gone."

Tam's grip on his hand tightened. They'd talked about this in the five minutes of quiet before Valdris arrived. About Mira's voice, about what it meant, about the impossible hope that lived now in Kael's chest alongside the memory of Vaelith's rage.

"The echoes," Valdris repeated slowly. "The fragments of magic left over from when the God-Engines fell. Your sister is alive in them?"

"Not alive. Not dead. Something else." Kael shook his head. "It doesn't matter right now. What matters is that I locked one door, and there are six more. And they all felt me do it."

The silence that followed was thick with implications none of them wanted to name.

Sera found them an hour later, her missing eye covered by a fresh bandage, the old one having been lost somewhere in the fighting.

"We've got a problem," she said without preamble. "Actually, we've got about twelve problems, but one of them is walking."

Valdris straightened. "The Magister?"

"Awake. And talking." Sera's jaw tightened. "He's asking for the boy. Says he has answers."

Kael exchanged a look with Tam. She shook her head slightly, but they both knew he was going to go anyway.

"Where?"

---

Magister Elan Torwen looked like a corpse that hadn't gotten the message.

His skin had gone gray, paper-thin over bones that seemed too sharp. His milky eyes were open but focused on nothing, or perhaps on everything. He lay on the infirmary bed like something already laid out for burial.

But his voice, when he spoke, was clear.

"The vessel returns." A ghost of a smile crossed his lips. "I didn't think I would live to see this. Any of it."

"You knew." Kael kept his distance, remembering how easily this man had used him. "You knew what Vaelith was. What I was."

"I suspected. We all suspected. But suspicion and certainty are different beasts." Torwen's eyes found Kael's face, tracking him with uncanny precision for a man who seemed barely alive. "Three hundred years, my family has served the Guild. Three hundred years of waiting for someone who could do what you did tonight."

"And you were going to, what? Use me as a weapon?"

"As a seal. There's a difference." Torwen coughed, a wet sound that spoke of damage beyond what the healers could fix. "The First Engineers built their prisons well, but prisons need maintenance. Every generation, Vaelith grows stronger. Every generation, the cage weakens. Eventually, without intervention, it would have broken free."

"So you found me. A vessel strong enough to survive the sealing."

"We didn't find you. You found us." Torwen's smile was bitter. "Your parents found the disk. Your parents fled with it, with you, hoping to escape what you are. They should have known better. The vessels are drawn to the prisons. It's in your nature."

Kael felt something cold settle in his chest. "My parents. What did they know?"

"Everything. Nothing. More than most, less than enough." Torwen's eyes drifted closed. "They were researchers. Good ones. They found records of the First Engineers that the Guild had buried. They understood what the God-Engines really were. And they understood that their son was something special."

"A vessel."

"A lock." Torwen's eyes opened again, and for a moment they were sharp, almost luminous. "The vessels before you could barely contain Vaelith's attention. You survived its full awakening. You turned a key into a seal. That's not just power. That's *purpose*."

Tam waited outside the infirmary, her back against the wall, the disk cool against her chest where Kael had left it with her.

She didn't know what to make of any of this. Two weeks ago, she'd been planning to spend the winter helping her uncle repair fishing nets. Now she stood in the conquered heart of a Tuner Guild compound, carrying a piece of an ancient god's prison, waiting for the boy she loved to finish talking to a dying man about the nature of existence.

*Loved.*

The word surprised her. She'd never thought it before, not in so many words. But it was true, wasn't it? She'd followed Kael across the Rustfields, through Changed territory, into the belly of his enemies. She'd felt him through the disk when he was miles away, a warmth that pulled at her like gravity.

The door opened. Kael emerged, his face unreadable.

"What did he say?"

"That I'm a lock. That I was always meant to be a lock." He took the disk from her, and the moment it touched his hand, it flared briefly with that cold, quiet light. "And that I should be ready. Because the other First Engineers are going to test me."

"Test you how?"

Kael looked toward the window, toward the darkness where Vanthem's heart should have been glowing.

"They're going to try to break their cages too. All of them. Because if one lock can be turned, the others will want to know if it can be broken."

---

Dawn came to Vanthem without the amber light that should have heralded it.

Kael stood on the roof of the Guild compound, watching the sun rise over a city that had lost its soul. The God-Engine's ribcage loomed above him, familiar and utterly changed. Without the heart's glow, it looked like what it truly was: the corpse of something ancient and terrible, a monument to power that should never have existed.

People filled the streets below. Not the panic of the night, but something worse: a quiet, stunned grief. Priests walked among them, speaking words of comfort that rang hollow. Guards kept order, but their faces held the same lost expression as everyone else.

"We can't stay here."

Valdris had climbed up to join him. The salvager leader looked out over the city with the eyes of someone who'd seen worse, somehow.

"The compound is defensible, but not against what's coming. The Guild will send more people. The city guard will eventually get organized. And if what you're saying is true about the other God-Engines..."

"We need to find the other fragments." Kael finished the thought. "Before they do."

"You said there are three pieces. You have one. We have one." Valdris's voice was careful. "Where's the third?"

Kael closed his eyes. He'd tried not to think about this. When Vaelith had torn through his mind, it had seen everything he knew. Including the Changed's warning about who had been hunting the fragments for eight hundred years.

"The Hollow's creator has it. Or knows where it is." He opened his eyes. "The thing that made the creature that's been hunting Tuners like me. It's been searching for the fragments since the Silence began."

"And now it knows you have one."

"It knows I turned one into a lock. There's a difference." Kael looked down at the disk in his hands, at the complete circle that had once been broken. "I think I surprised it. I think I surprised all of them."

Valdris was quiet for a long moment. Then he said: "My people have protected our fragment for eight hundred years. We've died for it. Killed for it. And we never knew what we were really guarding."

"A piece of a key that could free something that should never be freed."

"Or a piece of a lock that could seal it forever." Valdris met Kael's eyes. "You've earned our trust, Thornwood. You and your girl. When you're ready to move, we move with you."

From somewhere deep in the city, a bell began to toll. Not the frantic ringing of the night, but something slower. Something final. The Temple of the Slumbering God, marking the death of the only god Vanthem had ever known.

Kael listened to it ring, and felt the weight of six more gods waiting in the dark.

"Soon," he said. "We move soon."

Far to the south, in a ruined city whose name had been forgotten before the Silence began, something vast opened its eyes.

The key had turned.

And there were five more siblings waiting to be freed.
