They ran until Kael's lungs burned and Tam's breath came in ragged gasps.

The Changed territory's edge was marked by a wall of sorts: a ridge of fused debris where wild magic had compressed centuries of machine wreckage into something like a spine. Beyond it, the air cleared. The strange shimmers faded. The world became almost normal again.

Almost.

"There." Tam pointed to a gap in the ridge, a narrow passage where salvagers had carved through. "That's the crossing. We get through there, we're out."

Kael bent double, hands on his knees, fighting to catch his breath. The disk throbbed against his thigh like a second heartbeat, and he couldn't stop thinking about what the Changed had said.

*She fell into the echo.*

Mira. Somewhere in the space between worlds, between reality and magic, his sister might be waiting. Not dissolved. Not gone. Just... lost.

"Kael." Tam's voice snapped him back. "Focus. Grief later. Running now."

She was right. The smoke had thickened behind them, closer now. The Guild wasn't just tracking; they were herding. Burning the territory behind them to force Kael forward, into terrain they controlled.

They scrambled up the ridge. The fused metal was sharp in places, smooth in others, slick with something that might have been oil or might have been something else entirely. Kael's hands came away stained with iridescent residue.

At the top, he looked back.

The Rustfields stretched south like a sea of ancient bones. Changed territory was a wound in the landscape, its edges shimmering, its depths unknowable. And cutting through it, half a mile back, came a line of figures.

Eight of them. Moving with the precision of trained hunters.

They wore gray cloaks over leather armor, and each carried a staff topped with a glass bulb that pulsed with captured echo-light. Guild Trackers. The best. And at their head walked a woman in a coat the color of dried blood, her silver hair pulled back in a severe braid.

Kael's stomach dropped.

"Commander Ashford." Tam had followed his gaze. Her face went pale. "She's a legend. Thirty years in the field. They say she's never lost a target."

"Comforting."

"She's also the one who put down the Vasten Outbreak. Killed forty Changed in a single night."

"Very comforting."

Tam grabbed his arm. "We move. Now."

They half-slid, half-fell down the other side of the ridge. The passage opened into a rocky plain dotted with scrub brush and stunted trees. Real trees, these, not the warped copper-veined things of Changed territory. In the distance, maybe two miles north, a structure rose against the horizon: a watchtower, old but maintained, flying a flag Kael didn't recognize.

"Neutral ground," Tam said. "Salvager outpost. If we reach it, we can claim sanctuary."

"Will that stop the Guild?"

"It'll slow them down. Salvagers don't like uniforms, and Ashford can't just burn a treaty post. Too many witnesses."

They ran again. Kael's legs screamed. The disk had gone cold against his leg, dormant now that they'd left Changed territory, and he found himself almost missing its warmth. At least when it pulsed, he knew something was listening.

They were halfway to the tower when the first echo-bolt struck.

It came from nowhere—a streak of crystallized light that punched into the ground three feet to Kael's left. The impact threw him sideways. He rolled, came up tasting blood where he'd bitten his tongue, and saw Tam already on her feet, spear raised.

The Guild Trackers had crested the ridge.

Commander Ashford stood at the front, one arm extended. The glass bulb on her staff was empty now, its energy discharged. She was already loading another, pulling it from a bandolier across her chest with practiced efficiency.

"Kael Thornwood." Her voice carried across the plain, clear and cold. "By authority of the Tuner Guild, you are ordered to surrender. You will submit to examination. You will answer for the incident at Caderyn's Rest."

"And if I don't?" Kael called back.

"Then I will bring you in by force. And I am very, very good at force."

Tam positioned herself between Kael and the Guild. "We're on neutral ground. You have no authority here."

"Neutral ground begins at the tower, girl." Ashford smiled without warmth. "You're still in the Rustfields. Still in my jurisdiction."

The other Trackers spread out, forming a half-circle. Their staffs hummed with charged echo-bolts. Eight against two, and those two were exhausted, underequipped, and running on fumes.

Kael's hand went to the disk.

*No.* The thought came sharp and urgent. *Use it again and you send another signal. The Changed said something is hunting the fragments. Something old. Something that made the Hollow.*

But if he didn't use it, they'd be captured. Examined. And whatever secrets the disk held—whatever connection it had to Mira—would be picked apart by Guild scholars who didn't care about anything but power.

"I'm going to give you until the count of ten," Ashford said. "Then we open fire. Eight bolts at once, Mr. Thornwood. Even if you can do whatever it is you did to that Hollow, you can't block eight."

Kael's mind raced. The disk was cold. No echo nearby to draw from, no wild magic to channel. Whatever power it held, it needed a source.

"One."

Tam shifted her grip on her spear. "We can reach the tower if we run."

"Two."

"They'll shoot us in the back."

"Three."

"Then we fight."

"Against eight trained Trackers?"

"Four."

"Better than giving up."

Kael looked at her—really looked. Tam, who'd lost her mother to the current. Tam, who'd watched Mira dissolve and decided to never be afraid again. She wasn't going to run. Even if running was the smart play, she wasn't going to leave him.

"Five."

He thought of Mira. *She fell into the echo.*

He thought of the voice in the gears. *You carry a piece of me.*

He thought of everything he'd run from for three years, and everything he was still running toward.

"Six."

And he made a choice.

"Don't shoot," Kael said, stepping forward. "I'll come."

"Kael—" Tam started.

"No." He turned to her, and something in his expression made her stop. "You get to the tower. Tell them what happened. Tell them about the Changed, the fragments, everything. If they take me, at least someone will know the truth."

"I'm not leaving you."

"I'm not asking you to leave. I'm asking you to survive." He pressed the disk into her hand. Her eyes widened at its weight, its warmth—still alive, still listening, even cold. "Keep this safe. It's the only piece we have."

"Kael, I can't—"

"Seven." Ashford's voice was ice.

Kael turned back to the Guild. He raised his hands.

"I'm coming. No one shoots. She walks free."

Ashford regarded him with something that might have been curiosity. "The girl holds stolen Tuning artifacts. She's a person of interest."

"The girl holds nothing but a metal trinket. You want me—the one who drove off a Hollow with power you've never seen. She's just a villager. Let her go."

Silence stretched. The Trackers held their staffs steady, charged and ready.

Then Ashford smiled again—not warmth, but something closer to respect.

"Eight."

She lowered her arm.

"The girl goes free. You come with us. If you resist, if you try anything, we put her down anyway. Understood?"

Kael nodded.

He walked forward, hands up, every step taking him further from Tam. He didn't look back. If he looked back, he'd break.

The Trackers closed around him. Echo-shackles snapped around his wrists—bands of crystallized magic that hummed against his skin, suppressing his ability to Tune. They were cold. Everything was cold now.

Ashford stepped close. She was shorter than him, but her presence was vast—the weight of thirty years and a thousand hunts.

"You did something impossible," she said quietly. "Folded an echo inward. Banished a Hollow that shouldn't exist. And that thing in your pocket—the disk—I can feel it from here. Even through the shackles. It's not an artifact. It's something else."

Kael said nothing.

"The Guild wants to study you. Cut you open, maybe, and see what makes you different." She tilted her head. "But I've seen a lot of Tuners, Mr. Thornwood. Studied under the best. And I know when I'm looking at something that doesn't fit the rules."

"Is there a point coming?"

"The point is this: I don't think you know what you are. I don't think anyone does. And until someone figures it out, you're more valuable alive than dissected." She stepped back. "So behave. Answer questions. Don't make me regret letting the girl walk."

The Trackers began to march him south, back toward Changed territory, back toward wherever they'd come from.

Kael risked one glance back.

Tam stood on the plain, the disk clutched in both hands, watching him go. She wasn't crying. She wasn't screaming. She was just standing there, spear on her back, jaw set.

*Tell them the truth*, he thought. *Find the other fragments. Find out what I am.*

*Find Mira.*

The Trackers pushed him forward, and the distance grew.

But in his chest, something still pulsed. Not the disk—that was with Tam now. Something else. A warmth that hadn't been there before.

*You carry a piece of me*, the voice had said.

And Kael realized, with a strange calm, that it hadn't been talking about the disk at all.
