Kael woke to screaming.

Not the kind that faded when you opened your eyes. Not a nightmare bleeding into morning. This was real: high and sharp and coming from somewhere near the village center.

He was out of bed and down the stairs before his mind caught up with his body. Aunt Vera was already at the door, her salvager's hammer in hand, the one she kept by the stove for "negotiations."

"Stay here," she said.

Kael pushed past her and ran.

The village was in chaos. People spilled from their homes in various states of undress, some clutching children, others grabbing whatever weapons came to hand. The screaming had stopped, replaced by something worse: a silence that pressed against the ears like deep water.

In the center of the square, beside the old well, something stood.

It had the shape of a man. Two arms, two legs, a head. But that was where the resemblance ended. Its body was wrong: translucent in places, like clouded glass, and through it Kael could see the faint outlines of the buildings behind. Where its face should have been there was only a smooth, featureless surface. And it moved without moving, each position separate from the last, as if someone was cutting pieces from time and pasting them back out of order.

Kael's blood turned to ice.

He knew what this was. Every Tuner did. They'd heard the stories, the warnings, the whispered accounts from the old texts.

A Hollow. Something that had crossed through an echo and come back wrong. Not alive, not dead. Just... empty. Hungry for the thing it had lost.

They weren't supposed to be real.

"Kael." Tam appeared at his elbow, pale but steady. She'd grabbed a fishing spear from somewhere. It wouldn't do anything against a Hollow, but he didn't tell her that. "What is it? What do we do?"

"Stay behind me."

"That's not a plan."

"It's the only one I've got."

The Hollow turned. That featureless face oriented toward them, and Kael felt it: a pull, like hooks in his chest, like something reaching through the air between them and trying to tug out whatever made him *him*.

It wanted his echo. His essence. The thing that made a Tuner a Tuner.

*Something followed me.*

Mira. This was what she'd been warning him about. This thing had somehow come through with her message, ridden the connection between them, and now it was here, and it was hungry, and he was the only Tuner in Caderyn's Rest.

The only meal.

"Everyone get back!" Kael's voice came out stronger than he felt. "Get to your homes, bar the doors. This thing hunts echoes. If you're not a Tuner, it won't—"

The Hollow moved.

One moment it was by the well. The next it was ten feet closer, that stuttering, skip-frame movement that made Kael's eyes ache. The pull intensified. He staggered, and Tam caught his arm.

"Kael, you're glowing."

He looked down. His veins were lit from within, the telltale sign of Tuning, but he wasn't doing it deliberately. The Hollow was *pulling* it out of him.

"Run," he said. "Tam, run."

"Not without—"

"I said *run!*"

He shoved her away and faced the thing that had followed his sister back from wherever she'd gone. His heart was pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears. Three years of running from his power. Three years of pretending he was just a courier, just ordinary, just *safe*.

That ended now.

Kael reached for the echo inside himself. Not the ambient ones drifting through the world, but the core of it, the thing that made him a Tuner. It felt like grabbing a live wire. Pain lanced up his arms, his spine, exploding behind his eyes.

"Come on then," he said through gritted teeth. "You want it? Come and take it."

The Hollow lunged.

And Kael did something impossible.

He didn't push the echo outward, the way Tuners were trained. He pulled it inward, deeper, folding it into himself until there was nothing for the creature to grab. The hooks in his chest found nothing. The pull met a wall.

The Hollow stopped. Its head tilted, an eerily human gesture of confusion.

Then it screamed.

The sound wasn't audible. Kael felt it in his bones, in his teeth, in the marrow of his being. The Hollow convulsed, its form flickering faster, and then it was gone: not destroyed, just... elsewhere. Retreated.

Kael dropped to his knees. His veins were still glowing, brighter now, and the pain hadn't stopped. He could feel his edges blurring, the way Mira's had before—

"Kael!" Tam was there, hands on his shoulders, her face filling his vision. "Kael, stay with me. Don't you dare. Don't you *dare*."

He focused on her voice. Her face. The solidity of her hands. He pulled himself back together, piece by piece, and slowly the glow faded.

"I'm okay," he gasped. "I'm okay."

He wasn't okay. He'd just done something no Tuner should be able to do. And the Hollow wasn't dead. It was out there somewhere, regrouping, waiting.

It would come back.

Aunt Vera pushed through the crowd, her face ashen. She knelt beside him, and for a moment she looked old. Older than he'd ever seen her.

"That was a Hollow," she said quietly. "They're not supposed to exist anymore."

"I know."

"You just drove one off." Her eyes searched his face. "Kael. What are you?"

"I don't know." He let Tam and Vera help him to his feet. The villagers were staring at him. Some with fear, some with something worse: hope. "But I think... I think I need to find out."

He looked toward the horizon, toward the distant shapes of the Rustfields, toward the cities beyond where the God-Engines slumbered.

Mira had found a way somewhere. Something had followed her back. And now Kael had a terrible, growing suspicion that whatever she'd found, whatever she'd done, it wasn't just her.

It was connected to him.

It was connected to all of them.
