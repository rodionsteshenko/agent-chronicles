They had two hours before dawn, and a city that wanted blood.

Kael felt it in the echo-currents that swirled through Vanthem's streets: fear crystallizing into rage, grief curdling into blame. Someone had killed their god. Someone would pay.

"We need to move now." Valdris spread a salvaged map across the table in what had been Torwen's study. "My scouts report the city guard is massing at the Temple. The priests are calling for justice. They don't know who to blame yet, but they'll figure it out soon enough."

"The compound?" Tam asked.

"We can hold it for maybe a day. Two if we're willing to spend lives." Valdris traced a path on the map with one scarred finger. "There's a passage through the lower ribs that comes out near the northern road. Old maintenance tunnels from when the Guild still pretended to maintain the Engine. We get through there, we're in the Rustfields by sunrise."

Sera stood by the door, her remaining eye scanning the corridor. "What about the Magister? He's not walking anywhere."

The question hung in the air. Torwen was dying, that much was clear. But dying could take hours or days, and the knowledge locked in his ancient mind might make the difference between victory and extinction.

"I'll talk to him." Kael rose from his chair. "One more time."

---

The infirmary smelled of herbs and decay.

Torwen lay where they'd left him, but something had changed. His eyes were open now, fully aware, and they tracked Kael's approach with an intensity that belied his broken body.

"You're leaving." Not a question.

"We have to. The city—"

"Will hunt you until the end of time." Torwen's lips twisted into something that might have been a smile. "You extinguished their eternal flame. You'll be a monster in their stories for a thousand years."

Kael pulled a chair close to the bed. "Then give me something to fight with. You said there are six more God-Engines. Six more First Engineers. Where are they?"

"Scattered. Hidden. Even the Guild doesn't know all their locations." Torwen's voice grew weaker with each sentence, but his eyes burned. "Two in the eastern mountains. One beneath the Saltmere. One on an island that doesn't appear on any map. One in the ruins to the south—that one you've already woken."

"And the sixth?"

Torwen was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was barely a whisper. "The sixth is lost. Its location was purged from Guild records three hundred years ago, after the last time someone tried to find it. Whatever is inside that cage, the old Magisters decided it was better left unfound."

"But the fragment—"

"The third fragment knows." Torwen's hand moved weakly, grasping at Kael's sleeve. "The three pieces were forged together, cut from the same impossible metal. They remember each other. If you can get all three, you won't need maps. They'll show you the way."

Kael looked down at the disk hanging from his belt. The complete circle pattern seemed to pulse with distant awareness.

"The Hollow's creator has the third fragment. Or knows where it is."

"Yes." Torwen's grip tightened with surprising strength. "And now I'll tell you something that's been kept secret for eight hundred years. Something that could kill you or save you, depending on how you use it."

Kael leaned closer.

"The First Engineers didn't build their prisons alone. They had help. Humans, or something like humans, who understood what they were becoming and agreed to help them stop it. Those helpers were given gifts: the ability to seal the cages from outside, to reinforce the locks when they weakened." Torwen's eyes bored into Kael's. "Your bloodline carries that gift. Your parents knew. Their parents knew. And so on, back to the very beginning."

"I'm descended from the people who imprisoned the Engineers?"

"You're descended from the people they *trusted* to keep them imprisoned." Torwen's breath rattled. "That's why you're a lock, boy. Not because you're powerful—though you are. Because you were *made* for this. Your ancestors stood beside the Engineers as they walked into their cages. They promised to keep the doors sealed forever."

The weight of it pressed down on Kael's shoulders. Eight hundred years of history. Countless generations, all leading to him.

"Why didn't they tell me? My parents?"

"Because they hoped you could escape it. They saw what happened to your sister—how the echoes pulled at her, how she couldn't resist reaching deeper. They knew you were stronger, and they were afraid of what that strength would cost you." Torwen's hand fell away, exhausted. "They loved you. That was their mistake. Love makes people believe in impossible things."

Kael found Ashford in the corridor outside, her arms crossed, her face unreadable.

"Listening?" he asked.

"A commander knows her battlefield." She fell into step beside him as he walked toward the study. "So you're the heir to an ancient covenant. The chosen vessel of a power older than civilization."

"Apparently."

"And you're leaving to collect pieces of a god-prison while being hunted by something that's been killing Tuners for eight centuries."

"That's the plan."

Ashford stopped walking. When Kael turned to face her, he saw something he hadn't expected: uncertainty.

"I spent thirty years believing the Guild was humanity's best hope. That we were guardians of knowledge, protectors against chaos." She gestured at the ransacked study, the abandoned corridors, the darkness pressing in from every window. "Now I find out we were jailers who forgot what we were guarding. That our sacred duty was a lie built on a truth we weren't allowed to know."

"Will you come with us?"

The question surprised them both.

Ashford's jaw tightened. "I should stay. Rally what's left of the Guild. Try to rebuild something from the ashes."

"But?"

"But the Guild will want you dead. And right now, you're the only thing standing between the world and creatures that make the Hollow look like a minor inconvenience." She uncrossed her arms, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword. "I put down the Vasten Outbreak. Forty Changed in one night. At the time, I thought that made me a hero."

"And now?"

"Now I think it means I'm very good at killing things." She met his eyes. "You're going to need someone who's good at killing things, Thornwood. Someone who knows how the Guild operates, where their outposts are, what routes their trackers use."

"You'd betray your own people?"

"I'd betray a system that used me to do things I didn't understand for reasons I was never told." Ashford's voice hardened. "I've spent thirty years in service of a lie. That's enough. I want to serve something true for whatever time I have left."

They left at the edge of dawn.

The maintenance tunnels were narrow, slick with centuries of condensation, and alive with the whispers of dead machines. Valdris led the way, his salvagers moving with practiced silence through the darkness. Behind them came Ashford's small group—three Trackers who'd chosen to follow their commander rather than flee with the others.

Tam walked beside Kael, her shoulder brushing his in the tight space. Neither of them spoke. There would be time for words later, assuming there was a later.

Torwen had insisted on staying.

"I'll slow you down," he'd said, his voice fading even as his will remained iron. "And there's work to do here. The Guild's archives, the sealed records—someone needs to make sure that knowledge survives, even if Vanthem burns."

"You'll die."

"I've been dying for decades. Now I'll die usefully." A ghost of his old sharpness returned. "Besides, the priests won't kill a Magister. Bad luck, they'll say. I'll be a prisoner, perhaps, but prisoners can still talk. Still influence. Still prepare the way for what comes next."

Kael had wanted to argue. In the end, he'd simply clasped the old man's hand and felt the echo of ancient power flowing between them—a recognition of what they both were, what they both served.

"Find the fragments," Torwen had whispered. "Seal the cages. And when you face the sixth—the lost one—remember that some things were hidden for good reason."

---

They emerged from the tunnels into gray morning light.

The Rustfields stretched before them, endless and empty, the ruins of the old world scattered like bones across the landscape. Behind them, Vanthem's ribcage rose against the sky, dark and cold, a monument to a god that had lost its fire.

Bells still rang in the distance. The priests were calling the faithful, calling for answers, calling for blood. Word would spread. Every Guild outpost, every Tuner compound, every settlement from here to the mountains would know by nightfall: the heart of Vanthem had gone dark, and someone was to blame.

"How long to your outpost?" Kael asked.

"Three days if we push. Four if the weather turns." Valdris scanned the horizon, his experienced eyes reading the landscape for threats. "We'll need to avoid the main roads. Guild patrols will be thick, and by tomorrow, they'll have descriptions."

"And the second fragment?"

"Hidden where no one's looked for eight hundred years. My grandfather showed my father. My father showed me." Valdris's voice carried a weight of generations. "It's been our burden and our purpose. Now it's yours."

Sera moved up to join them, her scouts reporting all clear on the northern approach. "Movement in the city. Riders heading south. They're sending word to the other compounds."

"Then we move fast." Ashford drew her hood up, her red coat traded for salvager gray. "I know the patrol schedules for every station between here and the mountains. We'll ghost through their lines before they even know to look for us."

Kael looked back one last time at Vanthem. At the dead heart he'd silenced. At the city that would remember him as a monster.

*I didn't kill your god*, he thought. *I locked your prison.*

But he knew it wouldn't matter. Stories were easier than truth. Blame was simpler than understanding.

Tam's hand found his.

"Together," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Together."

They turned north, toward the Rustfields and the fragment waiting beyond them. Behind them, the bells of Vanthem faded into silence.

Far to the south, in the ruins of a forgotten city, something vast stirred beneath the earth. It had felt its sibling's cage slam shut. It had heard the lock turn.

Now it was curious.

Now it was hungry.

And unlike Vaelith, it remembered how to wait.
