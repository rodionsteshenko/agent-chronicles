Kael had heard stories about Vanthem his entire life. The city of bones. The heart that still beats. The place where the God-Engine fell and humanity built a civilization in its corpse.

Nothing had prepared him for the reality.

The ribs rose from the earth like the fingers of a buried giant reaching for the sky. Each one towered three hundred feet high, rusted metal thick as castle walls, curved and interlocking in patterns that defied geometry. Buildings clung to them like barnacles on a whale's skeleton. Bridges spanned between them, strung with lanterns that swayed in the evening wind.

And at the center, visible through gaps in the architecture, the heart still glowed. A sphere of pulsing amber light the size of a cathedral, suspended between the God-Engine's ribs by cables and scaffolding that had been maintained for eight centuries.

Kael's own heart answered it.

The warmth in his chest surged, not painfully but intensely, like recognition. Like coming home to a house he'd never seen.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Ashford's voice cut through his awe. "Terrifying, too. Most first-timers are too overwhelmed to notice that part."

The wagon rolled through the outer gates, past guards in the Guild's crimson livery, past merchants and pilgrims and workers who barely glanced at another prisoner transport. This close, Kael could feel the echoes. Not scattered and wild like in the Rustfields, but layered, dense, humming with centuries of accumulated power.

"The heart," he said. "It's still alive."

"Dormant. Not dead." Ashford leaned forward, her eyes catching the amber glow. "The priests would have you believe it's waiting for the faithful to wake it. The Guild knows better. It's not waiting. It's *thinking*. Very, very slowly."

"What is it thinking about?"

Ashford's smile had no warmth in it. "That's what we're hoping you can tell us."

Two hundred miles north, Tam was learning how to start a war.

The salvager outpost's planning room occupied the turbine housing's upper level, a space filled with maps, salvaged equipment, and the kind of organized chaos that spoke to years of careful work. Ren Valdris stood at the central table, surrounded by his lieutenants, moving carved pieces across a detailed map of Vanthem.

"The Guild compound is here." He tapped a position near the city's heart. "Built into the base of the fourth rib. Three access points. Main gate, service entrance, and a drainage tunnel that empties into the Copper Quarter."

"How do we know the layout?" Tam asked. She'd been included in the planning despite being an outsider. Maybe because of the disk that still hung around her neck.

"We've had people inside for decades." A woman with cropped gray hair and a missing left eye spoke up. Valdris had introduced her as Sera, his second. "The Guild thinks they wiped us out during the Purge. Killed our grandparents, burned our histories, salted our lands. But we survived. Some of us even joined them."

"You have spies in the Guild?"

Sera's remaining eye glittered. "We have *members* in the Guild. Two of them are assigned to the very compound where your friend will be held."

Tam felt something loosen in her chest. Hope, maybe. Or the beginning of it.

"How long until we can move?"

Valdris's expression darkened. "That's the problem. The compound is a fortress. Even with inside help, a direct assault would be suicide. We need to wait for the right moment. A distraction. Something that pulls their attention."

"We don't have time to wait." Tam's hand found the disk again, and it pulsed faintly at her touch. Warmer now than it had been. "They're taking Kael there to study him. To take him apart and figure out how he works. Every day we wait is a day they might decide they've learned enough from him alive."

"She's right." Sera crossed her arms. "Ashford's a pragmatist, but the Magisters aren't. If they think they can extract the knowledge directly..."

Valdris held up a hand. "I know. I *know*." He stared at the map like it had personally wronged him. "Give me two days to coordinate with our people inside. We'll find a way."

Two days. Tam thought about Kael's face as the shackles closed. The way he'd looked at her with trust she wasn't sure she deserved.

"One and a half," she said. "Then I'm going in alone."

The Guild compound wasn't a prison. It was worse.

Kael walked through corridors of polished metal and precisely cut stone, past rooms filled with equipment he couldn't name and specimens he didn't want to understand. Men and women in gray robes watched him pass with the detached interest of scholars examining a new insect.

They'd taken his traveling clothes and given him a simple tunic and trousers, both marked with the Guild's sigil. The echo-shackles remained on his wrists, though Ashford knew they were useless. A reminder, maybe. Or a test.

She led him to a circular chamber deep within the compound. The walls were covered with glyphs, some painted, some carved, some that seemed to shift when he looked at them directly. At the chamber's center stood a stone table, and behind it, a man who looked like he'd been carved from the same material.

"Magister Elan Torwen," Ashford said. "Head of Applied Theology."

Torwen was ancient, his skin paper-thin over prominent bones, his eyes a milky blue that suggested blindness. But when he turned toward Kael, there was nothing wrong with his sight.

"So." His voice was a whisper that somehow filled the room. "You're the one who spoke with Vaelith's voice."

Kael felt the name hit him like a physical blow. Vaelith. Something deep in his memory stirred, then retreated.

"I don't know that name."

"Of course you don't. No one has spoken it in eight hundred years." Torwen shuffled closer, his robes dragging across the floor. "The God-Engines had no names. We gave them numbers, classifications, categories. But they named themselves, once. Before we silenced them."

"You silenced them?" The warmth in Kael's chest flickered with something that might have been anger.

"Not *us*. Our predecessors. The ones who discovered that the God-Engines were not tools." Torwen's milky eyes fixed on Kael's face. "They were prisons."

Ashford made a small sound. Even she hadn't known that.

"Prisons for what?" Kael asked.

Torwen smiled, and it was the most unsettling expression Kael had ever seen.

"For the things that made them. The First Engineers. The ones who existed before humanity crawled out of the mud. They built the God-Engines to contain themselves when they realized what they were becoming." He reached out, and his cold fingers touched Kael's chest, right where the warmth burned. "And now one of them is trying to climb out of its cage. Using you."

---

The disk pulsed once, sharply, and Tam gasped.

"What is it?" Valdris was at her side instantly, hand on his weapon.

"I don't know." She pressed her palm against the metal, feeling its symbols shift beneath her fingers. "It's... reacting to something. Something happening to Kael."

"Can you tell what?"

Tam closed her eyes and tried to follow the thread of connection that still bound her to the artifact and, through it, to Kael. She felt distance. Stone. And beneath that, something vast and old stirring in its sleep.

"They're waking something up," she whispered. "Something inside him."

Valdris's face went pale beneath his weathering.

"Then we move tonight."

In the circular chamber beneath Vanthem, Kael Thornwood felt the First Engineer stir.

It didn't speak. Not in words. But he felt its attention focus on him, vast and ancient and hungry after eight centuries of isolation. He felt it recognize the fragment that had once been part of its whole. The Key that Tam now carried, miles and miles away.

*ONE*, something whispered in a voice like grinding gears. *WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?*

Kael's mouth opened, and words came out that weren't his.

"The circle was broken. The fragments scattered. But I remember where they lie."

Torwen's eyes went wide. Ashford drew her weapon, though what she thought she could shoot, Kael couldn't imagine.

Then the presence receded, and Kael sagged against the stone table, his own mind flooding back.

"Well," Torwen breathed. "That's new."

Kael tasted copper and realized his nose was bleeding. The warmth in his chest had become heat, uncomfortably close to pain.

"What just happened?"

"You spoke as Vaelith's vessel. For approximately four seconds." Torwen was already making notes on a sheet of parchment, his hand steady despite everything. "More importantly, you survived. The last vessel we found lasted less than one second before his mind shattered completely."

Ashford still had her weapon raised. "Magister. Is he a threat?"

Torwen considered this with academic detachment. "Oh, almost certainly. He's also our only chance to understand what's happening. The God-Engines are waking, Commander. All of them. We've detected pulses from seven sites in the past month." He turned back to Kael. "And I suspect you know why."

Kael thought of the Changed, of Seren's layered voice, of the warning about something hunting the fragments for eight hundred years.

"Because someone's been looking for the pieces," he said. "And I just told it where they are."

High above, in the ribcage of the fallen god, the heart pulsed once. Brighter than it had in centuries.

Across Vanthem, people stopped and stared at the sky.

And far to the north, in a salvager outpost that the Guild thought was extinct, Tam felt the disk burn cold against her skin and knew that time had just run out.
