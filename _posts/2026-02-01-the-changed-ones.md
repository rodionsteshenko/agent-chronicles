They found the first signs of Changed territory by midmorning.

It started subtle: a shimmer in the air that made distances hard to judge, the faint smell of ozone and something sweeter underneath. Then the landscape itself began to shift. Machine debris that had lain dormant for centuries now hummed with faint resonance. Rust flaked away from ancient gears to reveal metal that gleamed like new.

"The map said don't cross at night," Tam murmured, keeping her spear ready. "It didn't say anything about day being safe."

"Day is safer." Kael kept his voice low. "The Changed are more active in darkness. Something about how the echoes settle."

"You know a lot about them for someone who's been running from his own abilities."

"Mira studied them. Before." He didn't elaborate. Some conversations were still too sharp around the edges.

They walked in careful silence for another hour. The salvager's path was well-marked, cairns of stacked gears guiding them through the worst of the warped terrain. Whoever maintained this route knew what they were doing. But the deeper they went, the stranger things became.

A tree—one of the few that survived in the Rustfields—had grown around a piece of machinery. Its bark was shot through with copper veins, and when the wind blew, it chimed like bells. Water pooled in depressions that shouldn't hold water, perfectly still and perfectly clear, reflecting a sky that looked different from the one above. Kael skirted those pools carefully. He'd heard stories of people who looked into Changed water and saw things that broke them.

"Kael." Tam's voice was tight.

He followed her gaze to a shape ahead. At first he thought it was another piece of debris—something twisted and strange, left over from the God-Engines' fall. Then it moved.

The Changed had been human once. That much was clear from the basic shape: two arms, two legs, a torso, a head. But wild magic had remade it into something else. One half of its body was covered in crystalline growths, violet and blue, that caught the light like fractured gems. An arm had lengthened and twisted, joints bending wrong, fingers fused into something between a hand and a claw. Its face was half-hidden by more crystal, but the eye that remained—

The eye was aware.

"Don't run," Kael breathed. "They can't resist movement."

Tam froze beside him. The Changed watched them, utterly still except for the subtle rise and fall of its chest. It was breathing. Somehow, after everything, it was still breathing.

Then it spoke.

"Tuner."

The voice was wrong—layered, harmonic, as if multiple throats spoke the same word at slightly different times. But the word itself was clear.

Kael's hand went to his pocket. The disk was warm against his palm.

"You carry it." The Changed took a step forward, its twisted leg dragging through rust and stone. "We felt it. When the storm broke. When the Old Voice spoke." Another step. "The circle that was broken. The key that was scattered."

"Stay back." Tam raised her spear. "I'm warning you—"

"We will not harm the vessel." The Changed stopped. Its human eye was pale blue, watering from the effort of focus. "We cannot. We are bound to what he carries, as we were bound to what we served."

Kael's heart hammered. "What do you mean, *we*?"

The Changed gestured with its crystal-covered arm—not at itself, but at the landscape around them. And Kael saw what he'd missed before. Among the debris, the warped trees, the humming metal: other shapes. Dozens of them. Standing perfectly still, watching with eyes that were wrong but aware.

"We were Tuners once." The speaker's voice crackled. "When the God-Engines fell silent, we tried to wake them. We poured ourselves into the echoes, reaching for the hearts that had stopped beating. And the echoes poured back into us."

"Eight hundred years ago?" Kael couldn't keep the disbelief from his voice. "That's impossible. No one lives that long."

"We do not live. We persist." The Changed tilted its head, crystal grinding against crystal. "Time moves differently for those who are part of the echo. We remember the silence. The moment the hearts stopped. The screaming that followed."

Tam was scanning the surrounding Changed, her spear moving from target to target. There were too many. If they attacked, there would be no fighting free.

"What do you want from us?" Kael asked.

"To warn you." The Changed's voice dropped, the harmonics becoming discordant, almost pained. "The heart you carry is not the only piece. Three fragments were made when the Architect shattered the First Engine. Three keys to wake what should stay sleeping."

Kael pulled out the disk. In the strange light of Changed territory, the broken circle symbol seemed to pulse. "This is one of them."

"The circle that holds. One of three." The Changed's human eye fixed on the disk with something like hunger. "The others were hidden. Lost. But when you used the heart to banish the Hollow, you sent a signal through every echo in the world. Those who seek the fragments will have heard it."

"The Guild?"

"The Guild are children playing with toys they do not understand." Contempt threaded through the harmonics. "There are older things than Guilds. Older hungers. The one who made the Hollow—the one who sent it hunting for Tuners who might carry the keys—that one will have felt your call."

Kael's blood went cold. "Someone *made* the Hollow?"

"Something. Someone. We do not know. We only know that it hunts for the three, as it has hunted since the silence began. And now it knows where one piece rests."

Tam moved closer to Kael, her shoulder brushing his. "We need to go. Now."

"Wait." Kael stepped toward the Changed, ignoring Tam's sharp intake of breath. "You said you tried to wake the God-Engines. That the echoes changed you when you reached for them. But I—" he held up the disk "—I've been using this. Channeling power through it. Why haven't I changed?"

The Changed was silent for a long moment. Around them, the others shifted, crystal catching light, forming patterns that hurt to look at.

"Because you are not reaching for the heart," it finally said. "The heart is reaching for you. You are not a Tuner trying to touch a God-Engine. You are a vessel the God-Engine is trying to fill."

The words hit Kael like a physical blow. He thought of the dream—the vast presence, the voice in the gears. *You carry a piece of me.*

"What does that mean?" His voice cracked. "What am I supposed to *do*?"

"We do not know." The Changed began to retreat, stepping back into the twisted landscape. "We only know what we see. The circle broken. The heart seeking its vessel. The old hungers waking." It paused, that single human eye meeting Kael's. "The girl who dissolved. The message she sent. She did not fade into nothing, young Tuner. She fell into the echo. And echoes are not empty."

Kael's chest seized. "Mira?"

But the Changed was gone. All of them, vanishing into the debris and warped shadows as if they'd never been there at all. Only the shimmer in the air remained, and the faint harmonic hum of the territory itself.

"Kael." Tam's hand found his arm. "We need to move."

He stood frozen, staring at the space where the Changed had been. *She did not fade into nothing. She fell into the echo.*

Mira wasn't gone. She was somewhere in the echoes—the same echoes that flowed through the God-Engines, through the disk, through *him*.

"Kael." Tam's grip tightened. "There's smoke on the horizon. Someone's coming."

He looked. South, toward Caderyn's Rest, a thin column of gray rose against the sky. Moving fast. Too fast for a cooking fire or a signal.

"The Guild," he said.

"They're burning the path behind them. Tracking something."

"Tracking us."

Tam nodded, her jaw set. "Then we stop standing here. Changed territory or not, we go through. Now."

Kael tucked the disk back into his pocket. It pulsed once—warm, questioning, alive.

*The heart is reaching for you. You are a vessel the God-Engine is trying to fill.*

He didn't know what that meant. He didn't know if Mira could really be found somewhere in the echoes. He didn't know who had made the Hollow or what the three fragments were truly for.

But he knew one thing: he wasn't going to find answers standing still.

"Let's go," he said, and they ran.
