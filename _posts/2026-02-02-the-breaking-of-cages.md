The cell they gave Kael was almost comfortable. A bed with actual linens. A window—barred, but real—that looked out over the compound's inner courtyard. They even brought him food that wasn't gruel.

It would have been generous, if not for the runes carved into every surface. Containment glyphs, Torwen had called them. Ancient symbols designed to suppress echo activity. They made the air feel thick, like breathing through wet cloth.

Kael lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling, feeling the warmth in his chest pulse against its restraints. The connection to Vaelith was still there, muted but present. Like a door that had been locked but not sealed.

*You cannot hold me*, something whispered. *Not with stone. Not with symbols. Not with fear.*

"I'm not trying to hold you," Kael muttered. "I'm trying to survive you."

*The same thing, from where I stand.*

---

Tam had never been good at waiting.

The salvagers had moved with impressive efficiency once Valdris gave the order. Within two hours, their people inside the Guild had confirmed Kael's location: a containment cell on the compound's third level, near the research chambers. Within four, they'd mapped every patrol route, every shift change, every door that could be unlocked from the inside.

Now they waited in the drainage tunnel beneath the Copper Quarter, fifteen salvagers armed with weapons that hummed with salvaged echo-tech, and one girl who shouldn't have been there at all.

"You should stay here," Valdris said for the third time. "Guard the exit."

"No." Tam's hand found the disk at her chest. It was warm again, warmer than it had been since Kael's capture. She could feel something building through it. Something that made her teeth ache. "I'm the only one who can find him if things go wrong. I can feel where he is."

Valdris studied her for a long moment. Then he nodded.

"Stay close. Don't take any chances you don't have to."

"I'm not the one who takes chances." Tam checked the knife at her belt. "That's always been Kael's job."

---

The first explosion came from the eastern wall.

Kael sat up, heart hammering, as alarms began to wail throughout the compound. Through his window, he could see guards running, hear shouted orders, see the flicker of echo-weapons being activated.

The door to his cell flew open. Commander Ashford stood in the frame, her face grim.

"We're under attack."

"The salvagers." Kael's voice was flat. "They're coming for me."

"Impossible. The salvagers are—" She stopped, understanding dawning. "Extinct. We thought they were extinct."

"Apparently not."

Another explosion, closer this time. The containment runes on Kael's walls flickered, and for a moment, the warmth in his chest surged. He felt Vaelith stir, interested, *hungry*.

Ashford crossed to him in three quick strides and grabbed his arm. "Come with me. Now."

"Why would I—"

"Because whatever the salvagers think they're rescuing, it's not you anymore." Her eyes were hard. "Torwen's been studying the records. You're not the first vessel, but you're the first one strong enough to be *useful*. If Vaelith breaks free while you're inside this compound, inside this city, built on the bones of its prison—" She didn't finish. She didn't have to.

Kael let her pull him to his feet.

---

The drainage tunnel opened into a basement storage room that the Guild had apparently forgotten about decades ago. Tam emerged behind Valdris and his advance team, her knife in one hand and the disk clutched in the other.

"Tam." Valdris's voice was barely a whisper. "The disk. Is it—"

"Getting warmer." She could feel Kael now, somewhere above them. Alive. Afraid. And something else, something vast pressing against the inside of his skull like water against a dam. "We need to hurry. Something's happening to him."

They moved through empty corridors, past doors their inside people had unlocked, following the mental thread that connected Tam to the disk to Kael. Twice they had to hide while patrols rushed past toward the eastern wall, where Sera was leading the distraction team.

The stairwell to the third level was unguarded.

"Too easy," one of the salvagers muttered.

"Or they've got bigger problems." Valdris started climbing. "Stay alert."

They were halfway up when the lights went out.

Not just the lamps—the echo-lights, the containment runes, everything. The entire compound went dark and silent for three heartbeats.

Then the heart of Vanthem *pulsed*.

Even through layers of stone and metal, Tam felt it. A wave of amber light that seemed to pass through solid matter, that made her bones hum and her teeth sing. The disk in her hand flared so bright she had to shield her eyes.

And somewhere above them, Kael started to scream.

---

"We're out of time."

Torwen's voice was calm as he studied the instruments in his laboratory, even as the walls shook and the air filled with the scent of ozone and burning metal. Ashford had dragged Kael here instead of toward the escape routes, and now they stood before a circular array of salvaged God-Engine parts, arranged in patterns that made Kael's eyes water to look at.

"What is this?" Kael's voice came out ragged. The warmth in his chest had become heat, then fire. He could feel Vaelith pushing against his thoughts, trying to find purchase.

"A resonance chamber. Built from fragments of Vaelith's original prison." Torwen turned to face him, and his milky eyes seemed to glow in the flickering light. "We've been preparing for this moment for generations. We just didn't expect it to come so soon."

"Preparing for what?"

"For the First Engineer to try to escape." Torwen gestured, and two Guild Tuners moved to either side of Kael, their hands glowing with channeled echo-power. "And for someone who could survive long enough to help us stop it."

Ashford's weapon was in her hand. "Magister, we discussed extraction, not—"

"Plans change, Commander." Torwen's voice went cold. "If he leaves this compound, Vaelith goes with him. And then Vaelith reaches the other fragments. Do you understand what happens then?"

*YES*, Vaelith whispered in Kael's mind. *TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENS. TELL THEM I BECOME WHOLE. TELL THEM THE CAGES BREAK AND WE RISE AGAIN.*

*We?*

*MY SIBLINGS. MY EQUALS. THE OTHER SIX.* Vaelith's presence was a pressure now, squeezing Kael's thoughts into smaller and smaller spaces. *EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE WAITED. EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE DREAMED OF FREEDOM. AND NOW YOU WILL GIVE IT TO US.*

"No," Kael said, and he wasn't sure if he was speaking to Torwen or to the thing inside him. "I won't."

---

Tam hit the third floor at a dead run.

The corridor was chaos—Guild members running in every direction, alarms still wailing, that terrible amber light pulsing through every window. She followed the thread of connection, ignoring Valdris's shouts to slow down, to be careful.

Kael was close. Kael was in pain. And something was very, very wrong.

She rounded a corner and nearly collided with two Guild guards who were too startled to react before she was past them. Behind her, Valdris's people engaged, the corridor filling with the crack and hiss of echo-weapons.

There. A door, heavy metal, covered in runes that sparked and flickered. The disk was burning in her hand now, and she could hear something through it—not words, but the *shape* of words, ancient and terrible.

She threw herself against the door. It didn't move.

"KAEL!"

---

Inside the resonance chamber, Kael heard her.

*Tam.* The thought cut through Vaelith's pressure like a blade through fog. *Tam came for me.*

*SHE CARRIES MY FRAGMENT. SHE CARRIES A PIECE OF MY CAGE.* Vaelith's presence twisted with something that might have been hunger or might have been fear. *IF SHE ENTERS THIS ROOM, THE RESONANCE WILL—*

"Will what?" Torwen demanded. He'd been listening, somehow, reading Kael's expressions like text on a page. "What happens if the fragment enters the chamber?"

Kael felt the answer rise up from somewhere deeper than memory.

"The cage opens. Or the cage closes. Depending on which of us is stronger."

Torwen's eyes went wide. "Let her in."

"WHAT?" Ashford stepped forward, weapon raised. "Magister, if she has the fragment—"

"Then we can end this here. Tonight." Torwen's voice cracked with something that sounded almost like hope. "Eight hundred years of containment, and we might finally have a chance to make it permanent. Let. Her. In."

The door opened.

Tam stumbled through, the disk blazing in her hand like a captured star. Her eyes found Kael's—terrified, determined, *there*—and she held out the fragment.

"I brought it back," she said. "I brought it back to you."

Kael reached for the disk.

Vaelith *howled*.

And the world came apart.

---

Later, no one would agree on exactly what happened.

The survivors spoke of light—amber and white and something else that had no name, bleeding through reality like cracks in a shell. They spoke of sound—a chord that wasn't music, that was the opposite of music, that was silence so profound it became its own noise.

They spoke of the God-Engine's heart, visible through every window in Vanthem, flaring so bright that the city was bathed in artificial noon for seventeen seconds.

And they spoke of the boy.

The boy who stood at the center of the resonance chamber, holding a disk that burned with ancient fire, his eyes gone white as old bone. The boy whose mouth opened and spoke in two voices at once—one human, one older than humanity.

"YOU CANNOT CAGE WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE CONTAINED."

"Watch me."

The first voice was Vaelith, vast and furious and *awake*.

The second was Kael.

---

Tam watched as Kael fought a war inside his own skin.

The disk connected them, bridge and barrier at once. She could feel what he felt—the crushing weight of Vaelith's presence, the desperate scramble for purchase in his own mind, the way every thought had to be clawed back from encroaching darkness.

But she could also feel something else. Something that Vaelith, for all its ancient power, had not expected.

Kael was not alone.

Mira's voice, faint as a dying star but *present*, rose from somewhere within the echo. "Kael. *Kael.* Don't let go."

"Mira?"

*IMPOSSIBLE. SHE DISSOLVED. SHE FELL INTO NOTHING.*

"Echoes aren't nothing." Kael's voice was stronger now, and Tam felt something shift in the disk, in the chamber, in the air itself. "They're not empty. And she didn't dissolve. She *held on*."

He was pulling the disk's power inward, folding it the way he'd folded his echo against the Hollow. But this time, he wasn't blocking. He was *using*.

The resonance chamber lit up. Every piece of salvaged God-Engine metal began to hum, began to *sing*, as Kael channeled eight hundred years of accumulated echo-power through the fragment in his hands.

Vaelith screamed.

*YOU CANNOT—THIS IS NOT—I AM—*

"You are a prisoner," Kael said, and his voice was his own. "And this is your cage."

The disk's symbols rearranged themselves one final time. Three segments of a broken circle, clicking into place around a central point.

One key. Turned.

---

The light faded.

Kael collapsed, and Tam caught him before he hit the ground. The disk had gone dark in her hands—not cold, but quiet. Sleeping.

Around them, the resonance chamber was silent. Torwen stood frozen, his instruments shattered, his milky eyes streaming tears he didn't seem to notice. Ashford had her weapon half-raised but seemed unable to decide where to point it.

"Is it..." Tam's voice cracked. "Is it over?"

Kael opened his eyes. They were his own again—brown, exhausted, *human*.

"No," he said. "But it's not winning anymore."

He looked down at the disk, at the new pattern on its surface. The broken circle was no longer broken. The three segments had merged into something new: a complete circle, with a single point at its center.

"One key," he murmured. "One lock. And I think I just changed what it opens."

---

Ren Valdris found them there five minutes later, after the last of the Guild resistance had surrendered or fled.

He took in the scene—the unconscious Magister, the shell-shocked Commander, the boy and girl huddled together on the floor—and said the only thing that seemed appropriate.

"What the *hell* just happened?"

Kael laughed. It was a broken sound, but it was a laugh.

"I locked the door," he said. "But there are six more doors. And something tells me they all just heard the key turn."

High above the city, the God-Engine's heart pulsed once more.

Then, for the first time in eight hundred years, it went dark.
