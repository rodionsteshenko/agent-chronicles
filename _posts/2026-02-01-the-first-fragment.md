The salvager outpost rose from the Rustfields like a wound that had scabbed over with rust and ambition.

Tam stopped at the crest of the final hill, her lungs burning from three hours of hard travel. The outpost sprawled below: walls made of salvaged God-Engine plating, watchtowers cobbled from ancient gears and modern timber, and at its heart, a massive turbine housing that someone had converted into a main hall. Smoke curled from a dozen chimneys. Firelight flickered in windows made of polished copper sheets.

Safe. Or close enough.

She pressed her hand against the disk beneath her shirt. It had gone cold the moment Kael surrendered, as if it knew. As if it was mourning.

*"Find the outpost,"* Kael had said. *"Tell them everything. The three fragments. Mira. What I am."*

What he was. A vessel. Something ancient trying to fill a human shell.

Tam started down the hill.

Fifty miles south, Kael Thornwood watched the Changed territory recede through the barred window of a Guild transport wagon.

The echo-shackles burned cold against his wrists, their enchantments designed to suppress a Tuner's connection to nearby echoes. Standard equipment. Effective against anyone who drew power from external sources.

But the warmth in his chest remained.

Commander Ashford sat across from him, her blood-red coat immaculate despite two days of hard travel. She hadn't spoken since they'd broken camp that morning. Just watched him with those sharp eyes, cataloging every breath, every micro-expression.

"You're not afraid," she said finally. Not a question.

Kael met her gaze. "Should I be?"

"You're a captured Tuner being transported to Vanthem for 'study.' Most would be terrified."

"Most don't know what I know."

Ashford's lips curved, almost a smile. "And what do you know, Kael Thornwood?"

The wagon hit a rut, and Kael felt the warmth pulse once, twice, like a heartbeat. The shackles couldn't touch it. Couldn't even sense it.

"I know your shackles are useless."

The outpost guards found Tam before she reached the gates.

Three of them, emerging from positions she hadn't spotted, their salvage-patched armor marking them as Valdris crew. The woman in the lead had a crossbow loaded with an echo-bolt, its tip crackling with faint blue light.

"Name and business," the woman said. No greeting. No warmth.

Tam raised her hands slowly. "Tam. From Caderyn's Rest. I need to speak with whoever runs this place."

"Lot of people need things. Why should we care?"

Tam pulled the disk from beneath her shirt, letting it hang in the firelight. The symbols etched into its surface caught the glow and threw it back in fractured patterns.

The crossbow dipped. The woman's eyes went wide.

"Where did you get that?"

"It's a long story," Tam said. "And people are dying while I tell it to guards."

The woman exchanged glances with her companions. Something passed between them, a silent conversation Tam couldn't read. Then the crossbow came down entirely.

"Follow me."

---

"You're bluffing." Ashford's voice was steady, but Kael saw the way her hand had moved toward her sidearm. Subtle. Controlled. Dangerous.

"I'm not."

"Echo-shackles have bound Tuners for three hundred years. They work."

"On Tuners who reach for power." Kael leaned forward, and the warmth in his chest pulsed stronger. "I don't reach. I'm *being reached for*."

For the first time since he'd met her, Commander Veris Ashford looked uncertain.

"What are you?"

"I don't know yet." Kael felt the ancient presence stir, distant but aware. "But I think you might. I think the Guild knows more about the God-Engines than they've ever told anyone."

Ashford was silent for a long moment. Outside, the wagon wheels ground against packed earth, and somewhere a horse snorted.

"You're not the first," she said quietly. "Not in eight hundred years. But you're the first who might survive."

---

The outpost's main hall had been a turbine housing once, and you could still see the mounting brackets where the great machine had hung. Now it held long tables, a central fire pit, and approximately sixty salvagers who'd stopped eating to stare at Tam.

A man rose from the head table. Tall, weathered, with a beard threaded with gray and hands scarred by decades of working with dangerous metal. He moved like someone who'd seen combat.

"Ren Valdris," the guard said. "This one came in carrying... well. You should see."

Tam held up the disk.

The hall went silent. Not the natural silence of people paying attention, but something deeper. Heavier. The kind of silence that falls when history walks into the room.

Valdris crossed to her in three long strides. He didn't touch the disk, just stared at it with an expression Tam couldn't read.

"Where is the bearer?"

Tam's throat tightened. "The Guild took him. Commander Ashford."

Valdris closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they were hard as machine steel.

"Ashford. Of course." He turned to his people. "Clear the hall. This girl needs to eat, and then she needs to tell us everything." His gaze found Tam's. "The Guild has been looking for these fragments for centuries. They've killed to keep them hidden. Whatever your friend knew, whatever he told you, it wasn't enough."

"He told me there are three," Tam said. "One of three."

"Yes." Valdris's voice was hollow. "The First Engine was shattered by its creator before the Silence. Three pieces, scattered across the world. Your disk is the Key." He pointed at the symbols. "The circle that holds. My people have been guarding another fragment for generations."

Tam's heart stopped.

"The second fragment is here?"

Valdris shook his head. "Not here. Hidden. In a place the Guild has never found." He studied her face, searching for something. "You came alone. You carried this artifact across the Rustfields with the Guild and worse hunting for it. Why?"

Tam thought of Kael's face as the shackles closed around his wrists. The way he'd looked at her with something like peace.

"Because someone had to," she said. "And because he asked me to."

Valdris nodded slowly. "Good answer." He turned toward the back of the hall. "Get her food, water, and a bed. Tomorrow, we plan a rescue."

"Rescue?" Tam hadn't dared to hope.

"The Guild is taking your friend to Vanthem. We have people in Vanthem." Valdris's smile was cold and sharp. "And the last thing Commander Ashford expects is an attack from people she thinks are extinct."

---

Fifty miles away, Kael felt something shift in the warmth at his chest. A connection, thin as spider silk, stretching north.

The disk. Still his. Still bound to him.

And somewhere, somehow, Tam was still fighting.

He smiled.

Commander Ashford saw it, and for the first time, she looked genuinely worried.
