The echo-storm rolled across the Rustfields like a bruise spreading under skin.

Kael Thornwood crouched behind the rusted hull of what might have once been a God-Engine's hand, five fingers the size of temple columns half-buried in red dirt. His courier pack pressed against his spine, the documents inside worth more than he'd make in a year. A simple job. Cross the fields before the storm window closed, deliver the sealed letters to Vanthem, collect his payment.

Simple. Except the storm had come early.

He could feel it before he could see it properly, that familiar itch behind his eyes that meant magic was close. The echoes were building, unstable pockets of power left over from when the God-Engines had walked and the world had made sense. Most people couldn't feel them at all. Kael wished he was most people.

"Thirty minutes," he muttered, eyeing the roiling clouds. Lightning flickered inside them, but it was wrong, too blue, too structured. Echo-lightning. "I can make the ridge in thirty."

He didn't move.

The smart thing was to wait it out. Find a crevice in the ancient machinery, hunker down, let the storm pass. Storms rarely lasted more than a few hours. His client would understand.

But his client was Alderman Vess of the Tuner's Guild, and Alderman Vess didn't understand anything except results. Late delivery meant half payment. Half payment meant another month in his aunt's back room, another month of her looks, her silences, her unasked questions about why he wasn't using his gift, why he was wasting himself running letters when he could be—

Kael pushed off from the metal hand and ran.

The Rustfields blurred around him, a maze of debris that had been falling from the sky for eight centuries. Gears taller than houses. Pistons like fallen trees. Cable bundles thick as rivers, their copper cores long since scavenged. The God-Engines had been massive beyond comprehension, and when they'd fallen, they'd scattered themselves across half the continent.

The echo-storm gained on him.

He felt it in his teeth first, that humming vibration that meant the magic was close enough to taste. Then in his fingertips, a pins-and-needles sensation that made him want to clench his fists. His sister had loved that feeling. Said it was like the world was trying to tell her secrets.

His sister had dissolved three years ago, her body coming apart like morning mist, still smiling, still reaching for something only she could see.

The ridge was close. He could see the marker stones that meant Caderyn's Rest was just beyond, the village where he'd grown up, where everyone knew what he could do and pretended not to, where—

The echo hit him like a fist.

Kael stumbled, went down hard on one knee, the world suddenly too bright, too loud, too *much*. The storm was overhead now, and the echoes were everywhere, wild magic pressing against his senses, demanding to be let in. His skin prickled with potential energy. The air tasted like copper and ozone.

*Don't tune,* he told himself. *Don't reach for it. Just breathe.*

But the echo was strong, stronger than anything he'd felt in years, and it was... strange. Structured. Like someone had shaped it, given it form and purpose.

Like a message.

Against every instinct, Kael opened his senses and listened.

The echo poured into him, and for one terrible moment he was drowning in blue fire, in memories that weren't his, in a voice he knew better than his own—

*Little brother. I found it. I found the way back.*

*But something followed me.*

The echo collapsed. The storm rolled past. Kael knelt in the red dirt of the Rustfields, shaking, the taste of his sister's voice still burning on his tongue.

Three years dead.

And somehow, impossibly, Mira had just sent him a message.
