Sleep didn't come.

Kael lay in his narrow bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the sounds of a village that had forgotten how to be quiet. Footsteps on the street outside. Hushed voices that carried farther than people realized. Someone was crying, three houses down. A child, probably. He couldn't blame them.

His veins still ached. A dull throb that pulsed in time with his heartbeat, a reminder of what he'd done. What he'd become.

*What are you?*

Aunt Vera's question echoed in his head. She hadn't asked it again after helping him inside. Hadn't pressed. She'd made him tea, checked his eyes for dilation like she used to do with Mira, and then retreated to her workshop in silence. The hammer never left her side.

He rolled onto his side and watched the first gray light of dawn creep through the window. He'd been awake for hours, replaying the moment over and over. The Hollow's eyeless face. The hooks in his chest. The impossible thing he'd done.

Tuners pushed echoes outward. That was the fundamental principle. You touched the ambient magic, shaped it, released it. You didn't pull it inward. You couldn't. The human body wasn't meant to contain that kind of pressure. That was how you ended up like—

Like Mira.

Kael sat up, suddenly unable to breathe. He'd almost followed her. In that moment when he'd folded the echo into himself, he'd felt his edges start to blur. A few more seconds and he would have dissolved right there in the village square, leaving nothing behind but light and screaming and another Thornwood who pushed too far.

A knock at his door. Soft. Hesitant.

"It's unlocked."

Tam slipped inside. She was still wearing the same clothes from last night, her fishing spear propped against the doorframe like she expected another attack. Dark circles ringed her eyes.

"Couldn't sleep either?" She sat on the edge of his bed without asking. An old habit from childhood, from the nights when they'd both been scared of things in the dark. Back then, the monsters had been imaginary.

"Not really."

"Liar. You haven't slept at all." She studied his face. "You look terrible."

"You should see the other guy."

A ghost of a smile crossed her lips. "That's not funny."

"I know."

They sat in silence for a moment. Outside, a rooster crowed, too early and too loud, offended by the disruption to its routine.

"The village is talking," Tam said finally. "Old Man Garrett already left for the trading post. Says he's going to sell his mule, but everyone knows he's going to the Guild station in Ashwick."

Kael's stomach dropped. "How long?"

"If he pushes? Two days there, maybe half a day for the Guild to mobilize. Three days, four at most, before they're here."

"That's faster than I'd hoped."

"The Guild doesn't like unknowns. A Hollow attack, a Tuner who can do something impossible..." Tam shook her head. "They'll want to study you. Poke and prod and figure out what makes you different. And if they can't figure it out, they'll make sure nobody else can use it either."

The Guild's methods were legendary. Kael had heard the stories, same as everyone. Tuners who went in for "evaluation" and came out changed. Compliant. Or didn't come out at all.

"I can't be here when they arrive," he said. It wasn't a question.

"No. You can't." Tam met his eyes. "So where are you going?"

"Mira found something. Before she... before it happened. She was reaching for something, and now she's sent a message from wherever she went. And something followed that message back." He took a breath. "I need to find out what she discovered. Why it connected to me. Why I can do what I did."

"And where exactly do you plan to look?"

"Vanthem." The word felt heavy in his mouth. The city built into the ribcage of a fallen God-Engine. The largest Tuner population outside the Guild's headquarters. If anyone knew about echoes that acted like messages, about abilities that shouldn't exist, it would be there. "The old libraries. The independent researchers. Someone has to know something."

Tam nodded slowly. "That's a month's travel through the Rustfields. Echo-storms every few days. Changed beasts. Bandits who prey on refugees. And now a Hollow that knows your face."

"I'm aware."

"You'll die alone out there."

"Maybe."

"Which is why I'm coming with you."

Kael opened his mouth to argue, but Tam held up a hand.

"Don't. Just don't." Her voice was steady, but he could hear the fear underneath. The same fear she'd hidden last night when she'd refused to run. "I've known you since we were seven years old. I was there when Mira dissolved. I'm not letting you walk into the wilderness alone to meet the same fate."

"This isn't your fight."

"It became my fight when that thing appeared in our village square." She stood, pacing the narrow room. "When it tried to eat you in front of everyone I've ever known. When I held your shoulders and watched you almost fade into nothing." She stopped, facing away from him. "I thought I was going to lose you. Right there. In the same spot where we used to play as children."

Kael didn't have an answer for that.

"Besides," Tam continued, forcing lightness into her voice, "someone has to keep you fed. You're terrible at cooking and worse at bargaining. You'd trade your boots for a stale loaf of bread and call it a good deal."

"That happened once."

"It happened *twice*."

A laugh escaped him, surprising them both. It felt wrong, laughing after everything. But also right, somehow. Like a pressure valve releasing.

"Vera's not going to like it," he said.

"Vera's going to hate it. But she knows." Tam turned back to face him. "I talked to her last night, after you went upstairs. She's already packing supplies. Trail rations, water skins, her old salvager maps of the Rustfields. She knows you can't stay, and she knows you shouldn't go alone."

Kael felt something crack in his chest. Not magic. Something older. "She's not going to try to stop me?"

"She already lost Mira by doing nothing. I don't think she could survive losing you the same way." Tam moved to the door, collected her spear. "Pack light. We leave in an hour, before the village wakes up enough to start asking questions. The gate guards owe me a favor. They'll look the other way."

She was gone before he could respond.

Dawn painted the village in shades of rose and gold. Beautiful, in a way that felt like mockery. Kael stood before his aunt's workshop, a pack on his back, watching Vera pretend to adjust straps that were already perfectly secure.

"The Rustfields are worse than when I used to run them," she said, not meeting his eyes. "The echo-storms are more frequent. Stronger. Something's stirring them up."

"I'll be careful."

"Careful isn't enough." She finally looked up, and he saw it: the same expression she'd worn on the day Mira dissolved. The knowledge that she was losing someone, and the determination to pretend otherwise. "You need to be *smart*. Don't tune unless you absolutely have to. Don't fold the echo inward again unless it's life or death. That thing you did... it wasn't natural. It came close to killing you."

"I know."

"Do you? Because I've buried one Thornwood already. I can't..." Her voice broke. Just for a moment. Then she straightened, and the practical salvager was back. "There's something I need to tell you. About your parents."

Kael's heart stuttered. "What about them?"

"They didn't die in an echo-storm. That's what I told you. What I told everyone. But the truth..." She glanced around, checking the empty street. "The truth is more complicated. They were researchers. Before you were born, before they settled down, they studied the God-Engines. Tried to figure out why they went silent."

"I don't understand."

"Neither do I. Not fully. But they found something. Something that scared them enough to abandon everything, move to a backwater village, and raise their children far from any Tuner influence." Vera pressed something into his hand. A small metal disk, inscribed with symbols he didn't recognize. "Your mother gave me this before she died. Said if either you or Mira ever showed signs of being... different, I should give it to you. I always thought she meant the Tuning. Now I'm not so sure."

Kael stared at the disk. It was warm against his palm. Warmer than it should be.

"What is it?"

"I don't know. She never told me. But she said if you ever needed answers, it would help you find them." Vera closed his fingers around it. "Go to Vanthem. Find the independents. And Kael? Whatever you learn... come back. Promise me you'll come back."

He couldn't promise that. They both knew it. But he said the words anyway, because she needed to hear them.

"I'll come back."

Tam appeared from between the houses, her own pack secured, the fishing spear now a walking staff. She nodded once to Vera, a silent acknowledgment between two people who'd already said their goodbyes.

"Ready?" Tam asked.

Kael looked back at the village. At the massive gear that served as its gate, already creaking open for the day's traffic. At the houses where he'd grown up, the streets where he'd played, the people who would wake soon to find him gone.

At the spot in the square where Mira had dissolved, and where he'd almost followed her.

"Ready," he said.

They walked through the gate and into the Rustfields, the sun rising behind them, their shadows stretching long across the machine-littered plains. Somewhere out there, a Hollow nursed its wounds and remembered his face. Somewhere further, in a city built from the bones of a dead god, answers waited.

And somewhere else entirely, in a place between dissolution and death, a sister who should have been gone was still reaching out.

Kael gripped the metal disk in his pocket and kept walking.
