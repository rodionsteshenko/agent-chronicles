The Rustfields earned their name.

Kael had seen them before, on short salvage runs with Aunt Vera when he was younger. But walking through them was different. The debris stretched to every horizon: massive gears taller than houses, pipes thick as ancient trees, metal plates warped by centuries of echo-storms into shapes that defied logic. Rust painted everything in shades of dried blood and burnt orange, and the wind that threaded through the wreckage made sounds like breathing.

"Cheerful place," Tam muttered, adjusting the straps on her pack. They'd been walking since dawn, and the sun now hung low and orange on the western horizon. Her fishing spear tapped against twisted metal as they navigated the narrowing path between two collapsed structures. "I can see why your aunt loved it out here."

"She always said the fields were honest. You could see danger coming." Kael ducked under a bent pipe, its surface flaking rust onto his shoulders. "She also said never to stop moving before dark."

"How much farther to the waystation?"

"Another hour. Maybe two."

Tam made a sound that might have been a groan. "You're terrible at distances."

"I'm excellent at distances. I'm just optimistic about walking speed."

"That's worse."

They kept moving. The disk in Kael's pocket had grown warmer as the day progressed, a steady heat that pressed against his thigh. He'd checked it twice during their rest stops, but the symbols remained unchanged: unfamiliar lines and curves that seemed to shift when he looked at them from different angles. Trick of the light, probably. Or exhaustion.

Or something else entirely.

The waystation appeared as the last light drained from the sky. An old observation tower, half-collapsed, with a sheltered basement that salvagers had been using for generations. Vera's maps had marked it as safe, and when Kael pushed open the rusted door, he found evidence of recent occupation: fire-blackened stones arranged in a ring, scratched tallies on the walls counting days or trades, a stack of dried wood that someone had left for the next traveler.

"Home sweet home," Tam said, dropping her pack with obvious relief. She rolled her shoulders, wincing. "I'm going to feel this tomorrow."

"You wanted to come."

"I wanted to not let you die alone in the wilderness. There's a difference." She was already arranging kindling in the fire ring, movements practiced. "Make yourself useful. Check the perimeter. Make sure we don't have any neighbors with too many legs."

Kael climbed the tower's remaining stairs, testing each step before committing his weight. Most held. A few didn't. From the top, he could see the Rustfields spreading out in every direction: a metal graveyard beneath a sky turning purple with approaching night. No movement. No echo-glow on the horizon. Just stillness and the distant creak of cooling metal.

He almost missed it. A flicker at the edge of vision, maybe two miles back along their path. Something catching the last of the sunlight and then vanishing.

*The Hollow,* his mind whispered. *It's following.*

But when he looked again, there was nothing. Just rust and shadow and the vast emptiness of a world that had broken itself centuries ago.

He climbed back down.

Tam had the fire going by the time he returned, small and carefully tended to minimize smoke. She'd laid out their supplies: hardtack, dried meat, a precious block of cheese that Vera had insisted on packing.

"Anything?" she asked.

Kael hesitated. "I'm not sure. Maybe."

"That's reassuring."

"It was probably nothing. Sunlight on metal."

"Mm." Tam handed him a chunk of hardtack. "And if it wasn't nothing?"

"Then we should sleep in shifts."

They ate in silence. The fire crackled and popped, sending sparks spiraling upward through gaps in the tower's ruined ceiling. Somewhere in the darkness, something metallic groaned as the temperature dropped.

"You've been quiet today," Tam said eventually. "Quieter than usual, I mean."

"Thinking."

"Dangerous habit." She pulled her knees to her chest, watching him across the flames. "Want to talk about it?"

Kael pulled the disk from his pocket. In the firelight, the symbols seemed to writhe. "This thing hasn't stopped getting warmer since we left. Vera said my mother left it for me, but she didn't know what it was."

"May I?"

He handed it over. Tam turned it in her hands, frowning. "It's cold."

"What?"

"Cold. Like it's been sitting in a stream." She passed it back. "Are you sure you're not imagining things?"

The disk settled into Kael's palm, warm as fresh bread from an oven. He stared at it, then at Tam, something cold settling in his stomach that had nothing to do with the mountain air.

"It's warm to me. Right now."

Tam's expression shifted. "That's... unsettling."

"Add it to the list."

They sat with that for a moment. Then Tam reached over and squeezed his arm, brief and fierce.

"We'll figure it out," she said. "Whatever your parents found, whatever you are, we'll figure it out. That's what we're going to Vanthem for."

"What if we don't like the answers?"

"Then at least we'll know." She stood, stretching. "First watch or second?"

"First. I won't sleep anyway."

Tam nodded, arranging her bedroll near the warmth of the fire. "Wake me at midnight. And Kael? If you see anything, anything at all, don't play hero. Just wake me."

"I'm not the hero type."

"You keep telling yourself that." She closed her eyes, and within minutes her breathing had slowed. Exhaustion taking what will couldn't.

Kael sat with his back to the stone wall, the disk warm in his hand, and watched the fire burn. Outside, the wind picked up, threading through the Rustfields with that breathing sound he'd noticed before. Except now it seemed almost like words.

*Coming.*

He tensed, reaching for his echo instinctively. But there was nothing there to touch. No ambient magic, no stray remnants of the God-Engines' power. The Rustfields were dead, picked clean by centuries of scavenging, and his Tuning was useless without something to tune.

*Coming.*

Just the wind. Just his imagination. Just the paranoia of a man being hunted by something that shouldn't exist.

He gripped the disk tighter. The warmth pulsed, once, twice, like a heartbeat. And for a moment, impossibly, he felt something pulse back. A presence. Distant and vast and very, very old.

Then it was gone, and he was alone with the fire and the wind and the sleeping form of his only friend.

Dawn was still hours away. Kael kept his eyes on the darkness, and waited.
