Caderyn's Rest looked the same as it always did: a cluster of stone-and-salvage houses huddled around the great gear that served as the village gate, its teeth worn smooth by eight centuries of weather. Smoke curled from chimneys. Children chased each other between drying racks heavy with fish from the eastern streams. Normal. Safe. Boring.

Kael had never been so grateful for boring in his life.

His hands hadn't stopped shaking since the Rustfields. He'd shoved them in his pockets halfway home, but he could still feel the tremor, the echo of his sister's voice rattling around in his skull like a stone in an empty jar.

*Little brother. I found it.*

He walked through the gear-gate, nodding to old Henrick who sat there every evening for reasons no one had ever satisfactorily explained, and made his way toward the cramped house he shared with his Aunt Vera. The courier pack felt heavier than it should. He'd failed the delivery. Alderman Vess would be furious. That was a problem for tomorrow.

Tonight, he had bigger problems.

"You look like death warmed over and spat back out."

Kael stopped. Tam was sitting on the low wall outside the farrier's shop, long legs dangling, a half-eaten apple in one hand. Her dark hair was pulled back in its usual practical braid, and her eyes, sharp as always, were fixed on his face with uncomfortable intensity.

"Thanks," Kael said. "You look... like you're sitting on a wall."

"Weak." Tam hopped down, falling into step beside him. She was one of the few people in Caderyn's Rest who didn't look at him like he was either a miracle or a tragedy. Mostly she looked at him like he was mildly disappointing, which he found refreshing. "Seriously, what happened? You're pale. Paler than usual, I mean, and your usual is pretty pathetic."

"Echo-storm caught me in the fields."

Tam's expression shifted. Just for a moment, something flickered behind the sarcasm. She'd been there, three years ago. She'd seen Mira fade. "You okay?"

"Fine." The word tasted like ash. "Waited it out. Nothing dramatic."

She didn't believe him. He could see it in the way her jaw tightened, the way she didn't push. Tam always pushed. The fact that she wasn't pushing now meant she knew something was wrong and was giving him space to tell her.

He wasn't going to tell her.

"I need to get home," he said. "Aunt Vera's probably already planning my funeral."

"She does that every time you leave the village." Tam caught his arm, her grip surprisingly strong. "Kael. If you need to talk—"

"I don't."

He pulled away, more roughly than he intended, and didn't look back as he walked the rest of the way home.

Aunt Vera was waiting in the doorway, because of course she was. She was a small woman, wiry and weathered, with the same dark hair Kael had inherited and none of his talent for Tuning. She'd raised him and Mira after their parents died in an echo-storm when Kael was seven. She'd watched one of them dissolve. She wasn't about to let the other one out of her sight for long.

"You're late," she said.

"Storm."

Her eyes swept over him, cataloguing, assessing. Looking for the telltale signs of Tuning: the faint luminescence in the veins, the thousand-yard stare, the tremor in the hands.

He kept his hands in his pockets.

"Dinner's cold," she said finally, stepping aside to let him in. "There's bread."

The house was small and cluttered, every surface covered with the detritus of a life spent salvaging. Vera made her living trading in machine parts, the smaller pieces that could be pried from the Rustfields without too much danger. Gears and springs and mysterious components covered the table, the chairs, the floor. Kael had grown up learning to navigate the maze of metal.

He sat at the small clear space that served as his eating spot and stared at the bread she placed in front of him.

"Are you going to tell me what happened," Vera said, not a question, "or are we going to do the thing where you brood for three days and then pretend nothing's wrong?"

"I like option two."

"Kael."

He looked up at her. She was standing by the stove, arms crossed, face unreadable. She'd worn that same expression the day Mira dissolved. The day she'd held Kael back while his sister smiled and reached for something none of them could see and came apart like morning mist.

"I heard her," Kael said. "In the storm. I heard Mira."

Vera went very still.

"That's not possible."

"I know."

"The dissolved don't come back. They don't send messages. They don't—" She stopped, pressing one hand to her mouth. When she spoke again, her voice was carefully controlled. "What did she say?"

Kael closed his eyes. The words were burned into him, a brand he couldn't escape.

"She said she found it. The way back." He opened his eyes. "And she said something followed her."

Vera sat down heavily in the chair across from him. For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The house creaked around them, settling into evening. Somewhere outside, a child laughed.

"You have to tell someone," Vera said finally. "The Guild, the—"

"No."

"Kael—"

"I'm not going to the Guild." His voice came out harder than he intended. "They'll want to study me. Test me. Use me. That's what they do to Tuners who can do things other Tuners can't."

"And can you?" Vera's eyes were sharp now, searching. "Do things other Tuners can't?"

Kael thought about the echo in the storm. How it had felt different from any echo he'd ever touched. How it had seemed to reach for him specifically, like a letter addressed to his name.

"I don't know," he said. "But I'm not going to let them find out."

He stood, leaving the bread untouched, and climbed the narrow stairs to the room that had once been his and Mira's and was now just his, full of her absence.

*Something followed me.*

He lay in the dark and listened to the night sounds of Caderyn's Rest and tried very hard not to think about what might be coming.

He failed.
