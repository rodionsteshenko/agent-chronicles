Tam woke him just before dawn, her hand gentle on his shoulder.

"Your turn to sleep," she whispered. The fire had burned low, casting her face in soft orange and deep shadow. "Anything?"

"Nothing." Kael rolled his shoulders, stiff from hours against stone. "Wind picked up around the third hour. Some creaking. No movement."

"Get some rest. You look like death."

"Charming." But he moved to where her bedroll still held warmth, and within moments exhaustion claimed him.

The dream came immediately.

He stood in a vast space filled with turning gears, each one larger than any he'd seen in the Rustfields. They moved in perfect synchronization, a mechanical heartbeat that thrummed through his bones. And at the center of it all, something waited. Something massive and patient and old beyond imagining.

*You carry a piece of me,* it said. Not words exactly. The gears spoke in motion, in vibration, in the spaces between their teeth.

*What are you?* Kael tried to ask, but his voice had no sound here.

*What I have always been. What I am becoming again.*

The gears began to speed up. The heartbeat quickened. And somewhere in the distance, something screamed—a sound like glass dragged across metal—

"KAEL!"

He woke to chaos.

The waystation shook. Dust rained from the ceiling, and through the gaps in the ruined tower, Kael could see the sky had turned a sickly green. Purple lightning arced between the clouds, and the air itself seemed to vibrate.

"Echo-storm," Tam shouted, pressing herself against the wall. Her eyes were wide. "It came out of nowhere!"

That was impossible. Echo-storms took hours to form, and you could see them coming from miles away. But impossibility seemed to be Kael's specialty lately. He scrambled to his feet, reaching for his pack—and stopped.

The disk was burning against his leg.

Not painfully hot. Burning like a fever, like a sun trying to break through cloud cover. And through the heat, he could feel it: magic. Wild, chaotic, unstable magic surging through the dead zone like blood through awakened veins.

"We need to move," Tam was saying. "The basement might hold—"

The wall exploded inward.

Not stone. Something else. Something that moved in stuttering, skip-frame motion, translucent as clouded glass with a face that was no face at all. The Hollow had found them.

Tam screamed and threw herself backward, grabbing for her fishing spear. The creature didn't even look at her. Its empty face turned toward Kael, toward the heat in his pocket, and it made that sound again: glass on metal, hunger given voice.

Kael's hand went to the disk without thinking. In the village, he'd folded his echo inward to repel this thing. But here in the dead zone, he had no echo to fold. Nothing to tune. Nothing to—

The storm crashed into the waystation.

Magic poured through the broken walls like water through a burst dam. Wild, unstructured, lethal to any Tuner who tried to channel it. But the disk in Kael's hand was already moving, already reaching for the chaos. He felt it happen more than controlled it: the artifact pulled the raw power of the echo-storm into itself, shaped it, focused it.

And pushed it back out through him.

Light erupted from the disk—warm and golden, the opposite of the Hollow's cold translucence. The creature recoiled, its stuttering motion becoming jerky, erratic. But it didn't flee. Instead, it changed direction, moving toward Tam.

"NO!"

Kael didn't think. He stepped forward, placing himself between the Hollow and his friend, and felt the disk's warmth surge up his arm, through his chest, into his heart. The world became golden light and mechanical rhythm and a voice—that vast, ancient voice from his dream—speaking through him.

*BEGONE.*

The word wasn't his. The power wasn't his. But the intent was.

The Hollow shrieked. This time when it recoiled, it didn't stop. It folded in on itself, collapsing through angles that shouldn't exist, and vanished with a sound like shattering crystal.

The storm died in the same instant, as if someone had blown out a candle. The green sky faded to gray dawn. The purple lightning stopped. And Kael fell to his knees, the disk suddenly cold and inert in his palm.

"What," Tam breathed, "was *that*?"

Kael stared at the disk. The symbols on its surface had changed. Where before they'd seemed random, now they formed a clear pattern: a single circle, broken into three segments.

"I don't know." His voice came out hoarse. "It spoke through me. The thing in my dream, the voice in the gears. It used me like a... like a..."

"Like a conduit."

"Yes."

Tam moved to his side, her spear still clutched in white-knuckled hands. She looked at the hole in the wall, at the empty space where the Hollow had been.

"Is it dead?"

"No." Kael was certain of that. "Banished. Pushed out. But it'll come back. They always come back."

"Then we need to move faster."

He looked up at her. "You should leave. Find another waystation. Head back to Caderyn's Rest. This thing—" he held up the disk "—it's connected to whatever I am, and whatever I am brought that creature here. Every moment you spend with me is a moment you spend in danger."

Tam met his eyes. In the growing dawn light, he could see fear there. Real, honest fear. But underneath it, something harder.

"When I was eight," she said, "I watched my mother drown. A fishing accident. The boat capsized, and she pushed me toward shore before the current took her." She crouched beside him, her voice steady. "I spent years being afraid of the water. Afraid of anything that might take someone I loved. And then Mira dissolved, and I watched you break, and I decided I was done being afraid."

"Tam—"

"I'm not leaving you." She stood, offering her hand. "Now get up. We've got maybe six hours before whoever heard that storm comes looking. And I'd rather not be here when they arrive."

Kael took her hand. Let her pull him to his feet. The disk was cold now, but he could still feel something within it. Something sleeping. Something that had woken just enough to save them.

"Whatever this disk is," he said, "whatever my parents found—it's connected to the God-Engines. The voice said 'you carry a piece of me.' Like it's... alive."

"The God-Engines are dead. Everyone knows that."

"Everyone knows Hollows are extinct too." Kael tucked the disk back into his pocket. It warmed immediately, the faintest pulse of heat. "I don't think we know anything at all."

They gathered their scattered supplies in silence. The waystation had held, mostly—the Hollow's entrance had collapsed one wall, but the structure remained sound. Tam refilled their waterskins from the cache, and Kael found a salvager's map tucked into a crack in the stone, marking the path to Vanthem with Xs and warnings.

*Changed territory,* one note read. *Don't cross at night.*

*Guild outpost,* said another. *Avoid or bribe.*

Great.

"Ready?" Tam asked.

Kael looked back at the waystation. At the hole in the wall. At the stones where he'd sat through the long night, waiting for a danger that had found them anyway.

"No," he said. "But let's go."

They stepped out into the gray dawn, the Rustfields stretching before them like a rusted sea. Somewhere ahead, Vanthem waited. And somewhere behind—or around—the Hollow recovered, and the Guild pursued, and the God-Engines stirred in their ancient sleep.

But for now, they walked. One foot after another, toward answers or death or something in between.

The disk pulsed against Kael's thigh. Warm. Patient.

Waiting for whatever came next.
