Thirty hours into the tunnels, the hatchlings began to hunt.

Kira woke to the sound of wings—small, clumsy, but unmistakable. The storm-grey one she'd started calling Tempest had pinned a blind cave rat against the rock. Its lightning-bright eyes flashed with triumph as it bit down.

*Food*, it announced proudly through the bond. *I found food.*

The others stirred from the pile they'd made around Kira's body, drawn by the scent of blood. Within minutes, all twelve were awake and hunting, their infant flames casting dancing shadows on the tunnel walls.

"They're growing." Cael stood at the edge of the firelight, watching them. In the day and a half since the hatching, he'd barely slept. The copper-and-gold hatchling—the one who'd climbed onto him—never strayed far from his side. "That grey one was half this size yesterday."

"Dragon growth accelerates when they feed." Knowledge from Sorrenvex surfaced without Kira asking for it. "The first week is the fastest. By tomorrow, they'll be the size of hunting dogs."

"And then?"

"Then they fly."

Cael went quiet. The copper-gold hatchling chirped at him, and he absently scratched its head. The gesture was becoming automatic.

"She's bonded to you," Kira said. "You know that, right?"

His hand froze. "That's impossible. I didn't do any ritual. I don't have the fire."

"Neither did I, until I did." Kira watched his face in the dim light. "What happened in the palace, Cael? What did you really see?"

The silence stretched long enough that she thought he wouldn't answer.

"Prince Varek," he finally said. "In the east wing, three weeks ago. He was meeting with someone—a blood mage from the outer provinces. I was cleaning the antechamber, and they didn't notice me. Servants are invisible, you know?"

"I know."

"The mage gave him something. A vial. Said it would work better than poison—that it would corrupt the bond itself. Make the dragon turn on its rider." Cael's voice dropped. "Lord Aldric wasn't the only target. Varek commissioned the same weapon for his brother."

The words hit Kira like cold water. "His brother. The other prince."

"Prince Darian. Younger by three years, bonded to a bronze named Castellan. Varek means to kill him before the succession trials." Cael looked at her with hollow eyes. "That's why I ran. I tried to warn Darian's steward, but Varek's men caught me before I could speak. I've been running ever since."

A distant boom echoed through the tunnels. Then another. The hatchlings stopped their hunting, heads swiveling toward the sound.

Kira was already on her feet. "They're still coming."

"The tunnels branch here. Cael pointed to the dark opening ahead. "Left goes deeper into the mountain. Right climbs toward the eastern exit. I mapped this far three weeks ago when I was planning to run."

"How much farther to the exit?"

"Four hours. Maybe five."

Another explosion, closer now. Kira could feel vibrations through the stone.

*Danger*, Tempest announced, smoke curling from its nostrils. *Bad things coming.*

"Right tunnel," Kira decided. "Move."

They ran.

The hatchlings kept pace, some on foot, others attempting short gliding hops that sent them crashing into walls. Kira carried the two smallest—twins with scales like midnight, too weak yet for even these stumbling flights. Cael took the copper-gold one when it tired, cradling it against his chest like something precious.

The tunnel climbed. The air grew colder. Behind them, the sounds of pursuit grew louder—boots, shouts, the occasional crack of a crossbow bolt finding stone.

Then daylight.

The eastern exit opened onto a cliff ledge, fifty feet above a frozen river. Mountains stretched in every direction, white with early snow. The sun was setting, painting everything gold and red.

And blocking their only path down stood a man in bronze armor, sword drawn, eyes fixed on the tunnel mouth.

He wasn't wearing Varek's colors.

"Stop." His voice was younger than Kira expected—mid-twenties at most, with a face that might have been handsome if it weren't twisted with exhaustion and something like desperation. "Don't move. Either of you."

The hatchlings fanned out around Kira, twelve small bodies forming a protective arc. Tempest's lightning eyes crackled. The twins hissed in unison.

"Prince Darian," Cael breathed.

The man's gaze snapped to him. "You. You're the servant who tried to warn my steward." His sword didn't waver. "My men caught your message before it reached me. I've spent three weeks trying to find out what Varek buried."

"Then you know," Kira said carefully. "About the blood mage. The corrupted bond."

"I know my brother wants me dead. I've known that since we were children." Darian's eyes moved to the hatchlings, and something flickered in them—fear, awe, hunger. "What I don't know is what you are. No commoner should be able to bond a dragon, let alone twelve."

Behind them, the sounds of pursuit grew louder. Torchlight flickered in the tunnel depths.

"We can talk or we can run," Kira said. "Pick one."

Darian's jaw tightened. For a long moment, he seemed balanced on a knife's edge. Then his sword lowered.

"There's a path down the cliff. My dragon is waiting below." He turned toward the ledge. "Varek's men are an hour behind me—I disabled their route, but it won't hold forever. Can those things fly yet?"

"Tomorrow."

"Then we ride tonight." He was already climbing down. "Move."

Kira gathered her hatchlings and followed the prince who might save them—or might simply be a different kind of captor.

Either way, the mountain had run out behind her.

The only direction left was forward.
