The darkness inside the Sanctum lasted exactly three heartbeats.

Then light erupted from the walls themselves, racing up carved channels in patterns that had waited a thousand years to burn again. Blue fire, cold as mountain streams, spreading through the stone until the entire cathedral blazed with illumination.

Kira stumbled back. Tempest caught her with his wing.

The space that revealed itself made Thornwatch Keep look like a shepherd's hut. Columns stretched upward until they vanished into shadow, carved with dragons so detailed they seemed ready to breathe. Between them stood statues of men and women in ancient armor, hands resting on the heads of dragon companions frozen in stone.

The first dragonbonders. Kira knew it without being told. Sorrenvex's memories stirred, fragments of faces he'd known when this hall was young.

"The Sanctum recognizes you," Darian said from behind her. His voice echoed strangely, multiplied by the architecture. "It lit for your mark."

Kira looked down at her wrist. The dragonmark blazed brighter than she'd ever seen it, pulsing in rhythm with the blue flames.

Footsteps echoed through the chamber.

The hatchlings tensed, spreading into defensive positions. Castellan moved to shield Darian. Ember pressed close to Cael, copper-gold scales catching the blue light.

But the figure that emerged from the shadows wasn't a threat.

She was impossibly old. Skin like paper stretched over bird bones. Eyes that had gone white with age, yet somehow still saw. She walked without assistance, each step measured and certain, dressed in robes that might have been white a century ago.

"The Keeper of Echoes," Darian breathed. "The histories said you all died."

"The histories say many things." Her voice creaked like ancient hinges. "Most of them wrong." Those blind eyes fixed on Kira with unsettling accuracy. "You carry Sorrenvex. I can smell his fire in your blood."

"You knew him?"

"I knew them all, child. Every dragon that ever drew breath in this kingdom. I was here when the first eggs hatched. I will be here when the last ones cool." The old woman tilted her head. "But Sorrenvex's memories are why you've come. You seek the truth of what he witnessed."

Kira stepped forward. "Prince Varek murdered Lord Aldric. Sorrenvex saw it. I need to prove it."

The Keeper's lips cracked into something that might have been a smile.

"Then you need the Mirror of Binding."

---

The ritual chamber lay three levels beneath the main cathedral.

Kira descended alone. The Keeper had been clear: no dragons could enter. No human companions. The Mirror would only speak to those who carried memories not their own.

Stairs wound downward in a spiral that made her dizzy. The blue light faded as she descended, replaced by something older, something that lived in the stone itself and cast no shadows.

When she reached the bottom, she found a room that shouldn't exist.

Circular, perhaps fifty feet across. The walls were mirrors, each one slightly different. In one, she saw herself as a child, scrubbing scales in the dragon pens. In another, she wore armor and a crown, dragons circling overhead. In a third, she was dead, eyes staring at nothing while ash covered her face.

Possible futures. Possible pasts.

At the center stood a basin filled with liquid silver.

"Kneel," the Keeper's voice came from everywhere and nowhere. "Place your marked wrist in the pool. The memories will rise."

Kira knelt. The stone floor pressed cold through her trousers.

She lowered her wrist into the silver.

The world ended.

---

She was Sorrenvex.

Seventy years old, still young by dragon standards, scales gleaming purple in the morning light. Lord Aldric rode on her back, his armor polished to brilliance, his laugh ringing across the hunting fields.

No. Not her back. His back. She was seeing through dragon eyes, feeling dragon thoughts, living a life that had ended before she was born.

Time folded.

She stood in Lord Aldric's study, watching through the window as the old lord read by candlelight. His hair had gone grey, his movements slowed by decades, but his mind remained sharp. He was writing something.

A letter. Addressed to the King.

*I have evidence of Prince Varek's dealings with the blood mages of the southern reaches. Enclosed are copies of the correspondence I intercepted. The prince intends to corrupt the dragon bonds themselves, to ensure his brother cannot threaten his succession. I beg you to investigate before...*

The door opened behind Aldric.

Prince Varek entered, silver hair shining, eyes flat as polished coins.

"Lord Aldric. Still writing letters at this hour?"

"Your Highness." Aldric rose, folding the letter. "I didn't expect company."

"No. You never do." Varek crossed to the wine table. Poured two glasses. "A drink, my lord. To discuss certain rumors I've heard about your correspondence with my father."

He handed Aldric a glass.

Sorrenvex watched his bonded accept it. Watched the trust in Aldric's eyes because why would a prince he'd known since childhood offer poison?

The first sip.

Then the coughing. The clutching. The collapse.

Varek stood over the dying man, face empty, and took the letter from his twitching fingers.

"The problem with dragons," he said conversationally, "is that they make men too confident. Lord Aldric thought his bond made him untouchable. But bonds break when hearts stop. And hearts stop so easily."

Through the window, through a dragon's eyes, Kira watched Lord Aldric die.

And she watched Prince Varek smile.

---

The silver released her.

Kira surfaced gasping, wrist burning, tears streaming down her face. The memory lived in her now, sharp as a blade.

But something else had come with it.

She looked at the mirrors. Her reflections looked back.

"You understand now," the Keeper said. "Why commoner bonds are forbidden. Why the nobles feared what Pyreth offered you."

Kira wiped her eyes. "I don't..."

"The first dragonbonders were not nobles, child. They were shepherds. Farmers. Servants who stumbled into mountain caves and found eggs waiting for those brave enough to touch them." The Keeper's voice softened. "The noble houses came later. Blood magic to restrict bonding to certain bloodlines. Generations of careful breeding and magical contracts to ensure only the correct families could claim dragons."

The revelation hit like a physical blow.

"The noble bonds are artificial."

"Copies. Shadows of the true connection." The Keeper moved closer, her blind eyes somehow piercing. "What you have with your twelve is older than kingdoms. Purer. The nobles know this. They fear this. That is why a commoner bonding means death."

Kira looked at her marked wrist. At the symbol that had rewritten her life.

"If people knew..."

"If people knew, the noble houses would fall. Every farmer's daughter would seek the mountains. Every stablehand would dream of wings." The Keeper's smile was terrible in its kindness. "You didn't just bond twelve dragons, Kira. You lit a fire that will burn down the world they built."

---

Kira climbed the stairs in a daze.

Darian was pacing when she emerged. Cael sat against a pillar with Ember curled around him, but stood the moment he saw her face.

"Did you get it?" Darian demanded. "The memory?"

Kira nodded. She couldn't find words yet.

Cael crossed to her. His hand found hers, gentle, grounding.

"What else did you learn?"

She told them.

When she finished, Darian was pale as the ash outside. His jaw worked silently for a long moment.

"My entire family," he said finally. "Built on a lie."

"Your bond with Castellan is still real," Kira said. "But yes. The magic that restricts it to noble bloodlines is artificial. It was created to control power, not because nobility is required."

"If we reveal this alongside the murder..." Darian trailed off, seeing the implications.

"Civil war," Cael finished. "Commoners rising. Noble houses fighting to suppress them. Dragons choosing sides."

Kira looked at the Keeper, still standing in the shadows of the great hall.

"You knew this would happen," Kira said. "When you showed me."

"I know many things." The old woman's voice held no apology. "I know that lies built on blood magic cannot hold forever. I know that change always brings fire. And I know that you, child of no house, mother of twelve, have carried the proof of both truths across the Ashlands."

The hatchlings stirred around Kira, their minds pressing against hers with protective fury.

She felt Tempest's certainty. Ember's hope. The fierce love of twelve dragons who had chosen her because she was herself, not because magic told them to.

"How do we prove the memory is real?" she asked.

"I will write testimony." The Keeper moved toward a stone table covered in ancient parchments. "My seal has not been seen in five hundred years, but there are those who will recognize it. More importantly, I will teach you to project the memory for others to witness. What you saw, they will see. Varek's face. Varek's words. Varek's poison."

"How long?"

"Three days."

Kira looked at Darian. His shock had crystallized into something harder.

"House Morrow will declare for us," he said slowly. "With this proof, they must. But we need to decide how much else we reveal."

"All of it," Kira said. "No more lies. No more hiding the truth to protect a broken system."

Cael squeezed her hand.

Darian was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded.

"All of it."

---

Three days in the Sanctum.

The Keeper taught Kira to project memories through dragonfire, to shape flame into images that told stories. She learned that the blue light in the walls came from dragon tears crystallized over centuries. She learned that the Sanctum had been built as neutral ground, a place where any bonded could come regardless of house.

She learned that she was not the first commoner to bond, merely the first to survive long enough to reach this place.

On the second night, Varek's army reached the edge of the Ashlands.

The hatchlings spotted them from the Sanctum's towers: thousands of soldiers, hundreds of fires dotting the grey horizon like stars fallen to earth. Three dragons circled overhead, bonded to lords who had sided with the new king.

"They won't enter," the Keeper said. "Not even Varek is fool enough to march an army into the Ashlands. But they will wait. And when you emerge..."

"We fight," Darian said simply.

On the third day, Kira stood in the Sanctum's central hall with her proof crystallized in dragonfire and her twelve at her back.

The Keeper handed her a sealed scroll.

"My testimony. My seal. Take them to those who will listen." The old woman gripped Kira's shoulders with surprising strength. "Remember what you are, child. Not a stablehand who stumbled into power. A dragonbonder as the first ones were. The bloodlines will hate you for it. History will remember you regardless."

Kira tucked the scroll into her vest.

She thought about the army waiting outside the Ashlands. About the war that was already beginning. About the fact that she, Kira of no house, would stand at the center of everything that came next.

Then she thought about Tempest's certainty. About Cael's steady hand and Darian's fierce resolve. About twelve dragons who had crossed fire and ash to reach this moment.

She walked toward the gates.

The Sanctum had given her truth. Now it was time to share it.
