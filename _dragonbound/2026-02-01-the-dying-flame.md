The dragons knew when death was coming.

Kira had worked the royal pens for seven years, since she was twelve and old enough to haul water buckets without spilling. In that time, she'd learned to read them better than any stablehand twice her age. The way Thornscale's tail twitched before he snapped at the feeders. The low rumble Ashwing made when he was pleased. The exact temperature of flame that meant *warning* versus *threat*.

But she'd never seen a dragon prepare to die.

Sorrenvex lay in the deepest cavern, the one the nobles rarely visited because he hadn't accepted a rider in fifty years. His scales had once been the deep purple of twilight, or so the old handlers said. Now they were grey, flaking at the edges like ash waiting for wind. His eyes, when he opened them, still held the gold of ancient fire.

"You shouldn't be here," Marden said from the entrance. He was the head keeper, round-bellied and perpetually tired, and he'd stopped caring about most things years ago. But Sorrenvex made everyone nervous. "He's not eaten in three days. Could snap any moment."

"He won't hurt me."

Marden snorted. "Every handler who got themselves killed said that first."

But he left her anyway. He always did. Kira was useful precisely because she was invisible—a girl with no family name, no connections, no one who would notice if she disappeared into a dragon's maw. She could go where the noble-born handlers feared to tread.

She approached slowly, keeping her movements smooth. "Hey, old one."

Sorrenvex's massive head turned toward her. His nostrils flared, pulling in her scent. She'd been coming to him for months now, ever since she'd noticed the other handlers avoiding this cavern entirely. At first she'd just cleaned, swept, kept the torches lit. Then she'd started talking.

It wasn't forbidden, exactly. But servants didn't speak to dragons. Dragons were bonded to nobles at birth, linked by blood magic that granted both rider and beast extended life, shared senses, and the ability to channel dragonfire. A servant talking to an unbonded dragon was like a mouse chatting with a cat—absurd at best, suicidal at worst.

But Sorrenvex had never threatened her. He'd just... listened.

"You're leaving soon," she said quietly, settling onto the cold stone floor a few feet from his head. "Aren't you?"

A sound rumbled from deep in his chest. Not quite a growl. Something sadder.

"I don't know why you waited so long." She hugged her knees to her chest. "Fifty years. Everyone says you went mad with grief when Lord Aldric the Elder died. That you've been waiting to follow him ever since." She paused. "But that's not true, is it? You could have let go anytime. You were waiting for something."

Sorrenvex's eye, large as a dinner plate and filmed with age, focused on her with sudden intensity.

*Yes.*

Kira froze. The word hadn't been spoken—it had appeared in her mind like a stone dropped into still water, ripples spreading outward through her thoughts.

"You—" She scrambled backward, heart hammering. "You can't—servants can't—"

*You are not a servant.*

"I literally am." Her voice came out high and thin. "I shovel dragon dung for a living."

*You are what I have been waiting for.*

The dragon moved. Faster than something so ancient and broken should have been able to move. His head swung toward her, and Kira found herself frozen, unable to run, unable to scream, as that massive muzzle stopped inches from her face.

His breath was hot and smelled of copper and dying embers.

*I am sorry. There is no time to explain. No time to prepare you. They are coming, and you must know, you must carry what I know, or everything will—*

"What? Who's coming? I don't understand—"

*The bond will hurt. But you will survive. You must survive. The eggs, child. Remember the eggs.*

And then Sorrenvex pressed his brow to hers, and the world caught fire.

---

Pain. Blinding, searing, *tearing* pain, like her soul was being ripped open to make room for something else. She was aware of screaming—her own voice, raw and desperate—but it seemed very far away.

And then the memories came.

*A young man with kind eyes, laughing as a purple dragon hatchling climbed onto his shoulder. The same man, older now, crowned, worried, making a deal in shadows with someone whose face Kira couldn't see. A hidden place, deep in the mountains, where six eggs lay waiting in volcanic warmth. A choice: bond with the next ruler, secure the line—or wait. Wait for the one who would break everything open. Wait for—*

The memories shattered. Kira gasped, collapsing onto cold stone, and when she opened her eyes, Sorrenvex was still.

The great dragon's eye had gone dark. His chest no longer moved. The last warmth faded from his scales even as she watched.

"No," she whispered. "No, no, no—"

Her wrist burned. She looked down and saw it: a mark, like a brand, in the shape of a dragon's eye. Purple-black and raw against her brown skin.

The dragonbond.

She had been bonded. A servant girl, a nobody, bonded to a royal-line dragon in his dying breath.

It was impossible. It was illegal. It was—

"What have you done?"

Kira's head snapped up. A figure stood at the cavern entrance, torch in hand, face shadowed but voice unmistakable. 

Marden. He'd seen everything.

"I didn't—" she started, but her voice gave out. The mark on her wrist pulsed with heat, and in the hollow place where Sorrenvex's presence had been, she felt only echo and ash.

Marden stared at her. Then at the dead dragon. Then back at her.

"Stars preserve us," he breathed. "Do you have any idea what you've done?"

Kira didn't answer. She couldn't stop staring at the mark on her wrist—proof of something that shouldn't exist, couldn't exist.

Proof that everything she'd known about her life was about to burn.
