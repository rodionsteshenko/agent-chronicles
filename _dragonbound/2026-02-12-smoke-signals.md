The valley stopped being a secret the moment the hatchlings found the sky.

By noon, Darian’s people were moving like ants in a kicked nest. The watchtower refuge had been a place for waiting, for hiding, for whispering plans into smoke. Now it was a place for packing, for scraping evidence from the earth, for hauling supplies into satchels and arguing with gestures instead of words.

Kira stayed near the ruin’s broken wall with her dragons and tried to keep twelve minds from chasing every bird that crossed the fog.

They were learning what flight meant.

Not just hovering above a safe valley. Distance. Speed. Hunger that could be satisfied from above.

Tempest dove at shadows. The midnight twins invented a game of racing each other through the tower’s collapsed arches, wings snapping open at the last instant to avoid stone. The small green one stayed close to Kira’s boots, flinching whenever Castellan shifted his weight.

And the copper-gold hatchling never went more than an arm’s length from Cael.

When it flew, it flew in tight circles around him, as if the air itself was a tether. Every time it landed, it pressed its head hard into his shoulder, demanding reassurance.

Cael’s eyes had changed. Kira noticed it in the way he tracked movement now, how his gaze snapped to the horizon even when his body was still. A sharpness, as if the bond had filed down whatever softness fear had left him.

The scarred woman, the one who ran this refuge, watched him like she watched Darian: with the look of someone measuring how much trouble a person could become.

Fog thinned as the sun climbed.

With it came the first scout.

He slid down the hillside into the ruin’s shade, breath ragged, cloak streaked with pine needles and mud. He didn’t waste time on greetings. He looked at Darian, then up at the sky.

His face went grey.

Kira felt the words before he found them.

*Seen.*

The man thrust a scrap of cloth into Darian’s hand. A ribbon of royal blue, torn from a banner or a sleeve.

Darian’s jaw tightened until a muscle jumped.

The scout pointed west. Then pointed higher, toward the ridgeline.

Kira didn’t need the details. She could taste the shape of it. Riders. A village. Someone with eyes. Someone with hunger for reward.

Darian made a sharp chopping motion.

Move.

The refuge erupted.

Within the hour, the watchtower’s fire was drowned, the ash scattered, the meat stripped from its hooks. They carried what they could and destroyed what they couldn’t. A hiding place was only useful once.

Castellan was brought up out of his crouch. His wings unfolded, wide enough to darken the ground.

The hatchlings screamed their indignation into Kira’s blood.

*Sky again.*

*Now.*

*Hunt.*

Kira swallowed down panic and pressed both hands to the nearest scaled necks. The bond was a chorus, loud and bright and starving.

“Not yet,” she whispered, because whispering felt like control, even if none of them spoke words back.

Tempest snapped his jaws at the air.

From the tree line, a horse shrieked.

Kira jerked her head toward the sound. One of Darian’s pack animals had bolted, rolling its eyes white as it watched the hatchlings circle overhead.

A dragon was fear made flesh for most of Valdris.

Twelve young dragons were prophecy.

Darian mounted Castellan without ceremony. His people formed a line that threaded out of the valley into the forest, leaving nothing but trampled grass and the faint, sour scent of dragon.

Kira walked with Cael at the rear.

She didn’t ask where they were going.

She could feel Darian’s intent in the way Castellan kept low and still until the last possible moment. They weren’t heading to another hideout. They were heading to open ground.

The opposite of what every instinct told her to do.

They marched until dusk.

The forest thinned into rolling scrubland, then into low hills where the wind had teeth. The fog valley became a memory behind them.

That night, the hatchlings hunted.

It started with a rabbit.

Tempest spotted it, dove, and snapped it up in a clumsy bite that made the creature squeal once before it went still. The scent of blood hit the bond like fire to oil.

Kira felt twelve bodies pivot at once.

The dragons spilled over the hills in a wave.

She ran after them because she couldn’t not, because the bond dragged at her bones like a hook. Cael ran too, curses torn away by wind.

They crested a rise and saw the herd.

Deer, a dozen of them, huddled in a hollow where the grass had grown tall. They lifted their heads at the sound of wings and froze, sensing danger but not knowing its shape.

The hatchlings did.

They were not graceful, not yet. They crashed into the grass, stumbled, bit. But their teeth were already too sharp and their instincts too old.

Kira watched a storm-grey body slam into a doe’s flank and felt Tempest’s joy like a lightning strike.

*Mine.*

The deer scattered.

The dragons followed.

In the span of minutes, it became something else. Not a messy feeding. A coordinated hunt, as if the bonds between them weren’t just to Kira but to each other.

One of the midnight twins darted low and drove the herd toward the slope. The red-spotted one flared its little wings and snapped at legs, herding like a wolf.

Then the copper-gold hatchling screamed.

Not pain.

Warning.

Kira’s head snapped up.

She saw the glint first: iron in the grass. A line of it, almost invisible until moonlight hit.

A net.

Something embedded in it sparked with dark red light.

Blood magic.

Kira’s stomach turned cold. The stories about nets were old, the kind stablehands whispered about to scare children away from noble hunts. A net laced with binding runes could pin a dragon to the ground like a butterfly on a board.

But this net was different.

The red light wasn’t binding.

It was hungry.

Tempest hit it on a dive.

The moment his claws touched the mesh, Kira felt the bond twist.

Not pain.

Corruption.

A sourness that flooded her mouth, a wrongness in her blood, like someone had poured rot into her veins.

Tempest screamed, a sound that came through the bond as shards of ice.

Then his mind lurched.

For a heartbeat, Kira felt him looking at her the way a wild animal looked at prey.

No recognition.

No *mine*.

Only rage.

Kira stumbled, almost falling. The world tilted.

Cael grabbed her arm and hauled her upright.

Across the hollow, one of Darian’s scouts burst from the grass, sword out, trying to reach the net. A crossbow bolt took him in the thigh and spun him down.

More bolts hissed.

Men rose from the scrub with the smooth precision of an ambush. Not royal soldiers in shining armor.

Hunters.

Paid.

Their cloaks were brown, their faces smeared with ash. Their weapons were built for killing beasts that could breathe fire.

And at the center of them, holding a staff capped with a crystal that pulsed like a heart, stood someone in a dark hood.

Kira didn’t need Sorrenvex’s memories to know what that was.

Blood mage.

The copper-gold hatchling flew straight at the hooded figure.

Cael moved with it.

Not running.

Launching.

He surged forward with a speed that didn’t belong to a starving fugitive, as if the bond had poured heat into his muscles. He slid down the slope, scooped up the fallen scout’s dropped knife, and kept going.

The hatchling struck first, jaws closing on the mage’s sleeve.

The mage snarled and swung the staff.

The crystal flashed.

Kira felt the pulse hit her bonds like a hammer.

Two of the hatchlings faltered mid-flight and crashed into the grass.

Tempest’s mind bucked harder against hers.

Kira gritted her teeth and pushed back.

*Mine.*

Not a claim.

A command.

She poured herself through the bond, through the corruption, into the storm-grey hatchling’s frantic mind.

She found him in a place of thunder and hunger, a corner of his young soul being pried open by foreign magic that tasted like blood.

Kira grabbed him anyway.

She held.

The net sparked and smoked under Tempest’s claws.

Then a new presence slammed into the hollow.

Castellan.

The bronze dragon hit the earth like a falling tower, wings flaring, jaws opening.

Darian was already leaping from the saddle as Castellan’s fire poured out.

Not a wild blast.

A precise stream that cut the ambushers’ line in half.

Men screamed and rolled, cloaks igniting.

The blood mage threw up a ward, a red shimmer that took the fire’s edge and turned it into steam.

But steam didn’t stop a dragon’s weight.

Castellan lunged.

The mage turned to run.

Cael reached them first.

He drove the knife into the mage’s thigh.

The hooded figure collapsed with a choked cry, and the crystal staff skittered across the grass.

For an instant, the red pulse stopped.

Kira felt the bonds breathe.

Tempest’s mind snapped back into alignment so hard it made her gasp.

*Mother*, he cried, desperate and ashamed.

She ran to him, ripping at the net with bare hands until her palms bled. The blood-magic mesh burned like acid, but she kept tearing.

The hatchling surged free and slammed into her chest, all shaking wings and terror.

Around them, Darian’s people were fighting in the scrub, blades flashing, arrows slicing the air.

The ambush was breaking.

Not because they were losing.

Because they had what they came for.

Kira saw it as the blood mage, gritting teeth against pain, dragged himself backward on his elbows.

His free hand closed around a small glass vial that had fallen from his belt.

The liquid inside was not red.

It was grey.

It moved like smoke.

It moved like a living thing.

The mage smiled at Kira through the chaos.

Then he smashed the vial against the ground.

The grey smoke poured out and raced uphill toward the hatchlings like a tide.

Kira felt twelve minds recoil at once.

And somewhere deep in her own blood, Sorrenvex’s dying fire flared, not as comfort, but as warning.

Because this was not a net.

This was a plague meant for bonds.
