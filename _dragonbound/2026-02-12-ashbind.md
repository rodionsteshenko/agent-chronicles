The grey smoke climbed like it had claws.

It did not drift. It hunted.

It poured from the shattered vial, hugged the ground for a heartbeat, then rose in a sudden surge as if it had found a scent. Kira tasted damp ash and felt a probing pressure rake across her bonds, teeth searching for a seam.

*Back.*

She slammed the command through twelve links.

The hatchlings scattered. Wings flared. Claws tore turf. Tempest tried to launch and slammed into brush, hissing fury into Kira’s blood.

The smoke reached the small green hatchling first, the shy one that always stayed near her boots.

It latched.

Thin ribbons crawled toward the hatchling’s throat, and it screamed through the bond so sharply Kira’s vision stuttered. The hatchling dropped out of the air mid-glide and hit the hillside hard.

Kira ran.

She threw herself over it, pressing her body between its frantic heat and the ash-cold bite of the weapon. The smoke surged toward her wrapped wrist.

Sorrenvex’s dying fire flared inside her, not as comfort, as instruction.

An instinct surfaced: clean flame, used to burn rot from a bond before it took.

Kira forced her stolen fire outward.

Heat surged from her palm into the hatchling’s scales. The little dragon convulsed, claws digging into her arms. Grey smoke hissed and peeled back.

The recoil lasted a heartbeat.

Then the smoke snapped forward again, angry now, skimming across Kira’s bonds like a hand raking coals.

Cael hit the ground beside her.

The copper-gold hatchling rode his shoulder, neck arched. It inhaled once and exhaled a thin stream of pale fire, like molten coin.

Where it touched the smoke, the grey turned brittle. It cracked in the air.

Cael’s face tightened as if the act cost him breath, but the ribbons crawling toward the green hatchling’s throat snapped and withered.

The hatchling sagged against Kira’s chest.

Not dead.

Wrong.

The bond to it felt thinned, bruised, like a rope rubbed almost to fray.

Castellan roared.

Darian was up on the bronze dragon’s neck, braced like a man riding an earthquake. Castellan exhaled a flat sheet of fire that skimmed the grass and turned the ground into a black, glassy line.

The smoke struck that line and stalled, writhing at the edge, trying to crawl around, trying to find a living bond to bite.

Darian’s people were already pulling back, dragging their wounded, finishing what they could and abandoning what they couldn’t. The blood mage was hauled past Kira, hood down.

Young. Hollow-cheeked.

He smiled at Kira like devotion made flesh.

Kira’s stomach turned.

*Move,* she sent through the bonds, hard enough to hurt. *Away. Follow the bronze. Now.*

Tempest finally got his wings under him. The others followed in clumsy, terrified arcs.

The green hatchling stumbled, smoke residue still smeared along its jaw like soot.

They fled until the sky lightened.

They hid in a cut of earth deep enough to swallow Castellan’s bulk. The hatchlings collapsed around Kira in a heap of heat and claws.

The green hatchling did not sleep.

It lay with its head on Kira’s thigh and stared at nothing.

Kira pressed her palm to its neck. The bond answered faintly, trembling.

Not broken.

Contaminated.

Darian came down the slope without his sword in hand. He didn’t ask questions. He wrapped Kira’s torn palms with cloth from his belt, tight and practical.

Cael sat apart, the copper-gold hatchling curled across his shoulders. His eyes caught light strangely now, as if he could see the shape of wind.

When Kira met his gaze, he nodded once.

No comfort.

Just recognition.

Four days passed.

They moved at dawn and dusk, hid at midday, and crossed the eastern scrub in a rhythm that felt like being chased by a storm. Twice, scouts returned with news of riders.

Not Varek’s bright-armored soldiers.

Messengers. Neutral cloaks. House banners Kira didn’t recognize.

The kingdom was waking up.

On the fifth night, Darian led them to an old hilltop ring of standing stones, half-sunk and lichen-choked, carved with spirals that made Kira’s eyes water if she stared too long.

The hatchlings went quiet the moment they crested the hill.

Castellan refused to enter.

He stopped at the edge and lowered his head, nostrils flaring, like he smelled something he didn’t like.

Darian’s jaw tightened. He didn’t force the dragon.

Kira stepped through.

The mark on her wrist burned through bandage and cloth.

The hatchlings followed, one by one, pulled by something older than hunger.

The green hatchling stumbled. Its bond flickered.

Kira caught it and held it close.

Inside the ring, the world went quiet in a way the outside world never was.

Then the grey residue on the hatchling’s jaw lifted.

It rose in a thin curl and slid toward the nearest standing stone.

The stone drank it.

Kira felt the bond swell, not stronger than before, but clean.

The hatchling blinked once, then twice, as if waking from fever.

Kira sat down hard on the cold grass, legs shaking.

The weapon had teeth.

But so did the old world.

Darian entered the ring only after Kira looked up and nodded. He stepped in like a man choosing a trap because the alternative was worse.

Beyond the hill, a distant glow marked a town. Somewhere beyond that, the capital. Somewhere beyond that, a palace full of people who believed blood decided who could ride fire.

Kira flexed her newly wrapped hands.

“This is only the first,” she said.

Darian’s expression didn’t change.

But Castellan, waiting outside the stones, lifted his head and rumbled low and grim.

Kira looked down at the twelve hatchlings gathered around her legs.

They were no longer just fugitives.

They were proof.

And proof always demanded an answer.
