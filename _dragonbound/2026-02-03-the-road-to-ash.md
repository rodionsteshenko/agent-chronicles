Five days on the road had taught Kira three things: sleep was a luxury, hunger was a constant, and the princes of Valdris moved faster than she'd feared.

She crouched behind a boulder on the mountain pass, watching the patrol ride by below. Six riders in royal colors, their horses' breath fogging in the thin air. They carried torches despite the daylight, the better to check faces in the shadows of the road.

Searching for her.

The wanted notices had appeared on the third day. Kira had seen one nailed to a post in a village she'd crept through at dawn, stealing bread from a windowsill. The sketch was rough but recognizable. COMMONER MURDERER, the words read. KILLED ROYAL DRAGON. REWARD: 500 GOLD MARKS.

They'd twisted it, of course. Made her the villain instead of the victim. But the result was the same—every farmer, every merchant, every beggar with dreams of wealth was now her enemy.

The patrol passed. Kira waited until the hoofbeats faded, then scrambled up the rocky slope, keeping low. The volcanic peaks loomed ahead, wreathed in perpetual smoke. Sorrenvex's memories pulsed in her mind like a second heartbeat, guiding her toward the hidden clutch.

*Three more days*, the knowledge told her. *Through the Ashfall Pass, past the abandoned mining town, into the heart of the Smoking Range.*

She climbed until her muscles screamed, then climbed more.

---

The mining town was supposed to be empty. Sorrenvex's memories showed it abandoned decades ago, when the volcanic vents had shifted and made the tunnels too dangerous to work. A perfect place to rest, resupply, scavenge whatever the miners had left behind.

Instead, Kira found soldiers.

She spotted them from the ridge above—a full encampment in the town square, tents bearing the silver dragon of the royal house. Forty men, maybe more. Horses picketed near the old smelting works. A command tent with guards at the entrance.

They weren't searching randomly. They were waiting.

*They know*, Kira realized, her blood going cold. *Someone told them where I'm heading.*

But that was impossible. No one knew about the eggs except—

Except Lord Aldric had known. And Lord Aldric had been murdered by Prince Varek, who would have had access to the old lord's papers, his journals, his secrets.

The prince didn't just want her dead. He wanted what was in her head. The location of twelve unbonded dragons, enough to reshape the balance of power in Valdris forever.

Kira backed away from the ridge, mind racing. She couldn't go through the town. Couldn't go around—the cliffs on either side were sheer and impassable. The only other route would add weeks to her journey, and she was already running out of time. Out of food. Out of luck.

A hand closed around her ankle.

She kicked on instinct, twisted, but the grip was iron. A body surged up from the rocks where it had been lying in perfect stillness—a young man, lean and dirty, with the look of someone who'd been living rough as long as she had.

"Quiet," he hissed, clamping his other hand over her mouth. "You want them to hear?"

Kira bit him.

He swore but didn't let go. Instead he dragged her backward, behind a larger outcropping, out of sightline from the camp below. Only when they were fully hidden did he release her, shaking his wounded hand.

"Charming," he said. "I save your life and you take a chunk out of me."

"Save my—" Kira scrambled to her feet, grabbing a loose rock as a weapon. "Who are you? How long have you been following me?"

The man raised his hands, showing empty palms. He was maybe a year or two older than her, with dark hair that needed cutting and eyes that held a strange glitter—almost gold in certain light. His clothes had once been fine, she realized. The cut of a noble house, now torn and mud-stained.

"I haven't been following you," he said. "I've been *running*. Same as you, I suspect." His eyes dropped to her wrapped wrist. "Same as anyone who's crossed the royal family lately."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Sure you don't." He lowered his hands slowly, deliberately unthreatening. "I'm Cael. I was a servant in the palace until three weeks ago, when I saw something I shouldn't have and had to disappear. Now I'm trying to get across the mountains before Varek's men find me." He nodded toward the encampment. "Clearly I'm not the only one with that idea."

Kira studied him. He could be lying. Probably was—everyone in Valdris lied when survival was at stake. But his fear was real. She could smell it on him, sharp and familiar.

"There's another way," Cael said. "Through the old mines. Most are collapsed, but a few tunnels still run clear. I've been mapping them for days, looking for a path through."

"Why are you telling me this?"

He smiled, and there was something bitter in it. "Because I've seen the notices. I know who you are. And I figure anyone who managed to bond with a royal dragon and then escape the castle in the same night is either very lucky or very good." He shrugged. "Either way, I could use a partner. Traveling alone out here is suicide."

Kira's grip tightened on her rock. "You don't know anything about me."

"I know you're heading for the Smoking Range. I know the soldiers down there are waiting for you specifically. And I know that if we don't move in the next hour, the evening patrol will spot us both." Cael started walking, heading for a crevice in the rocks that Kira hadn't noticed. "Come with me or don't. But decide fast."

He disappeared into the shadows.

Kira stood alone on the ridge, the cold wind cutting through her thin clothes. Below, a soldier laughed at some joke, the sound carrying up like a taunt.

She thought of Sorrenvex. Of his memories pressing against her mind. Of the twelve eggs waiting in the volcanic heart of the mountains, patient as stone.

*Trust no one*, common sense whispered.

*Find allies where you can*, Sorrenvex's wisdom answered. *Even the dead need the living to carry their fire.*

Kira dropped the rock and followed Cael into the dark.

The mines were worse than she'd imagined.

Not collapsed—Cael had been right about that. But *alive*, in a way that made Kira's skin crawl. The walls pulsed with heat. Strange lichens glowed in patches, casting sickly green light. And somewhere in the depths, something was breathing.

"Don't mind that," Cael said when she froze at the sound. "It's just vents. Gases from the volcanic chambers below."

"Gases don't have heartbeats."

He paused. Listened. His face went pale in the phosphorescent glow.

"Move faster," he said, and started running.

They ran through tunnels that twisted and forked, Cael navigating from memory or luck or desperation. The breathing grew louder. The heat intensified. Kira's wrapped wrist began to *glow*, the dragon mark burning through the fabric like an ember.

"What the hell is that?" Cael gasped, staring at her arm.

She didn't answer. Couldn't. Because she knew, suddenly, what was making that sound. What was waiting in these mountains. What Sorrenvex had really been guiding her toward.

The eggs weren't hidden.

They were *guarded*.

The tunnel opened into a vast chamber, and Kira stumbled to a halt at the edge of a precipice. Below, in a lake of molten stone, something massive shifted. A head rose from the magma—scaled, ancient, eyes like twin suns.

Not a dragon. Something older. Something that predated the bond, the houses, the kingdom itself.

It looked at Kira. At the mark on her wrist. And it *smiled*.

"Little hatchling," it rumbled, voice like grinding continents. "We've been waiting for you."
