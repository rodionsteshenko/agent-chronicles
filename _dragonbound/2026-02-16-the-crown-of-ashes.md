They found Varek in the throne room.

Kira reached the castle's inner keep an hour after Darian's pursuit, climbing through corridors she'd scrubbed on her hands and knees as a girl. The marble was cracked now, scorched where blood-ward traps had detonated against coalition soldiers pressing inward. Tapestries that had hung for centuries lay in smoldering heaps. The castle was surrendering itself room by room, its defenders dropping weapons and stepping aside as the tide of inevitability washed through.

Tempest couldn't fit through the halls. She left him in the courtyard with the hatchlings ringing the keep like sentinels, their combined presence a weight that pressed against the walls. Cael walked beside her, Ember on his shoulder, the copper-gold dragon small enough still to navigate the corridors. Solace followed at a distance, her newly green scales scraping the stonework, too large for comfort but unwilling to let Kira out of her sight. The dragon moved like something newly born, each step tentative, testing whether the ground would hold or whether this freedom was another cruelty.

The throne room doors were open.

Castellan filled most of the chamber. The bronze dragon had come through the great windows, shattering the stained glass that depicted a thousand years of noble bonds, and now crouched among the colored shards with his wings folded tight. Darian stood before the Iron Perch, the ancient seat that served as Valdris's throne, his sword drawn but lowered.

Varek sat on the Perch.

He looked diminished. The silver hair that had always caught torchlight hung lank and grey. His armor was half-removed, the breastplate discarded on the steps, revealing the quilted gambeson beneath stained dark with sweat. A thin line of blood ran from his left temple where something, probably falling stonework, had caught him during the chase.

At his feet lay a dead man in the robes of a blood mage. The mage's throat had been cut. By the angle of the wound and the dagger still in Varek's hand, he'd done it himself.

"I killed the last of them," Varek said. His voice echoed in the vaulted chamber. "Three blood mages. Thirty years of investment. All dead now." He looked at the dagger in his hand as if surprised to find it there. "They were supposed to ensure the succession. Father was so worried about the succession."

Darian hadn't moved. "Stand up, Varek."

"Or what? You'll strike me down on our father's throne?" A ghost of the old arrogance surfaced. "That would make a fine image for your coalition. The younger brother, sword bloody, standing over the body of the king."

"You're not king," Kira said.

Both princes turned. Varek's eyes found her and something complicated moved through them: hatred, recognition, and underneath it all, the baffled fury of a man who had been undone by someone he'd never bothered to see.

"The stablehand," he said. "Tell me, girl. When you were mucking out Sorrenvex's stall, did you dream of this?"

"I didn't dream of anything. I was too tired."

She walked past Darian, past Castellan's massive flank, until she stood at the base of the Perch's steps. This close she could see Varek's hands trembling. Not with fear. With exhaustion. He had been running on blood magic's borrowed fire for months, maybe years, and now that his mages were dead the debt was coming due all at once.

"Lord Aldric," she said. "You poisoned his wine. Sorrenvex watched you do it."

"Sorrenvex was a dying beast clinging to memories that should have died with him."

"He was the last honest bond in this castle. Until you helped kill that too."

Varek stood. It cost him. His knees buckled and he caught himself on the Perch's arm, and for a moment he was just a man in his fifties, sick with withdrawal from magic that had been eating him from inside. He descended two steps and stopped.

"You think this changes anything?" His voice dropped low. "You'll put Darian on this throne and within a year the noble houses will strangle him. They'll smile and bow and slide knives between his ribs because that is what power does in Valdris. It eats its young." He looked at his brother. "I was trying to prevent that. Everything I did was to make us strong enough that no house could challenge the crown again."

"You murdered a man who trusted you," Darian said.

"I made a decision Father was too weak to make." Varek's chin lifted. "Aldric controlled the largest dragon outside the royal line. He was building alliances against us. In ten years he would have had the throne. Father knew it. He just couldn't act."

"So you poisoned him and stole his dragon's grief."

Varek said nothing. His silence was its own confession.

Kira felt Solace push through the ruined doorway behind her. The green dragon's head entered the throne room, her amber eyes locking onto Varek with the intensity of a creature who remembered everything that had been done to her even if she couldn't yet put those memories in order. A low sound built in her throat. Not a growl. Something closer to a keen.

Varek flinched.

It was the first honest emotion Kira had seen from him. Not the calculated rage or the political maneuvering. Just animal fear at the sight of what he'd created.

"She remembers you," Kira said quietly.

"Take me to the cells." Varek's voice had gone flat. "Whichever ones still have doors. Hold a trial if it makes your coalition feel righteous. But do it quickly, before the noble houses realize they can bargain for my head and start another war over the price."

Darian sheathed his sword. He climbed the steps and took the dagger from Varek's unresisting hand. Then he gripped his brother's arm, not gently, and led him down.

Coalition soldiers met them at the door. Varek walked between them without looking back.

Three weeks dissolved into the work of building something from rubble.

Kira didn't see the trial. She was in the dragon pens, which weren't pens anymore. She'd ordered the chains struck on the first day, and the red and silver dragons who'd been imprisoned alongside Solace had walked into the open air and stood blinking at a sky they hadn't seen in months. The red one, a mature female named Ashara, had launched herself upward with such force that the ground cracked beneath her feet, and she'd circled Thornwall for six hours before landing on the outer wall like a gargoyle and refusing to move.

She was still there. Kira brought her food every morning.

The silver, a young male called Frostbite by the keepers, wouldn't leave the pens at all. He'd pressed himself into the corner of his old cell and snarled at anyone who approached. Solace spent hours with him, her green scales pressed against the bars, making low sounds that weren't quite words. One morning Kira came down and found them sleeping side by side, the cell door open, Frostbite's head resting on Solace's flank.

Marden appeared on the fourth day.

He came through the east gate with thirty-seven servants, the survivors of the uprising who'd been trapped inside the castle when the fighting turned worst. He had a broken arm set in a rough splint and burns across the left side of his neck where a blood-ward had detonated too close. He walked up to Kira, looked at the fourteen dragons arranged behind her in the courtyard, and said nothing for a long time.

"I had you cleaning stalls for six years," he finally said.

"Seven."

"Seven." He rubbed his face with his good hand. "I knew what you might be. What any commoner might be, if the blood seals were broken. I knew because my grandmother told me, and her grandmother told her. We kept the secret because keeping it kept us alive."

"And selling it kept you fed."

"Yes." He didn't flinch from it. "I won't ask forgiveness, Kira. I'll ask for work. The dragons still need keepers, and I'm the best you have."

She made him wait three days before she said yes.

The trial lasted a week. Kira gave testimony on the second day, projecting Sorrenvex's memories through Tempest's fire onto the walls of the great hall for every lord, lady, soldier, and servant packed into the chamber. The silence when Varek's image lifted the poison vial over Lord Aldric's wine was the loudest sound she'd ever heard.

They sentenced him to exile beyond the Ashlands, stripped of name and title. Some argued for execution. Darian refused. "Enough blood," he told the council, and something in his voice ended the debate.

On the day of sentencing, Darian walked to the Iron Perch and didn't sit.

"This throne was built on a lie," he told the assembled court. "For a thousand years we've claimed that noble blood grants the right to bond, the right to rule, the right to sit above you. It was never true. The first bonders were farmers and fishermen and stablehands. The noble houses stole that birthright with blood magic and rewrote history to justify the theft."

The hall erupted. He waited until it didn't.

"I won't sit a stolen throne. Not as my father sat it. Not as my brother tried to." He drew his sword, the same one he'd carried through every battle since the Ashlands, and laid it across the Perch's arms. "Valdris will choose its own shape now. A council of houses and commons, bonded and unbonded. I'll serve on it if you'll have me. But I won't rule you."

Kira, standing at the back of the hall with Cael's hand in hers, felt something shift. Not in the room. In the world. A door opening that could never be closed again.

Spring came to Valdris like an apology.

Two months after the gates fell, Kira stood on the high field above Thornwall where Sorrenvex had spent his last decades and watched sixteen dragons wheel against a sky so blue it hurt. The hatchlings weren't hatchlings anymore. They'd grown to the size of warhorses, each distinct, each brilliant. Tempest led them in formations that were half-military drill and half-play, banking and diving and chasing each other through cloud banks while Castellan watched from a thermal with the patient tolerance of an old soldier supervising cadets.

Solace flew with them now. She'd chosen her own bond three weeks after the battle, pressing her forehead to a twelve-year-old commoner girl named Wren who'd come to the pens every day to sing to her. The bonding had been quiet and gentle and nothing like what Kira had experienced with Sorrenvex. Wren had cried. Solace had wrapped her wings around the girl and held her until she stopped.

It was the first legal commoner bond in Valdris since the blood seals were cast a thousand years ago. It would not be the last. Already petitions were arriving at the new council from every corner of the kingdom, common folk who felt the pull, who had always felt it and had never been allowed to answer.

Cael sat beside Kira in the grass, Ember sprawled across both their laps, her copper-gold scales warm from the sun. Ember had grown the least of all the hatchlings. The Keeper of Echoes, who had traveled from the Sanctum to serve on the new council, said it was because her fire was pure, undiluted by size, and that she would always burn hotter than dragons twice her weight.

"Darian asked me to sit on the council," Kira said.

"What did you tell him?"

"That I'd think about it."

"You've been thinking about it for two weeks."

She picked at the grass. Below them, Thornwall was rebuilding. The walls still bore scorch marks. The southern gate hung on temporary hinges. But the markets were open, and the sound of hammers rang from dawn to dark, and in the new dragon yards, where the chains had been melted down to build bridges, three commoner children were learning to bond with hatchlings from a clutch that had been found in the mountains north of the Ashlands.

Found. Not hidden. Not guarded. Just there, as if they'd been waiting for a world that was ready to receive them.

"I was invisible for nineteen years," she said. "I scrubbed floors and mucked stalls and no one knew my name. I don't know how to be the person they're asking me to be."

Cael's golden-flecked eyes caught the light. "You flew into a corrupted dragon's face to save a city. You walked into a kingdom and made it see you. I think you already are that person."

She leaned into him. Ember chirped.

Above them, Tempest broke formation and dove toward the field, pulling up at the last moment to skim the grass so close his wingbeats scattered Kira's hair. Through the bond she felt what he felt: the thermals like rivers in the sky, the sun on his storm-grey scales, the unshakeable certainty that the world was exactly where it should be.

Kira stood up. She brushed the grass from her clothes, the same plain clothes she'd always worn, no armor, no crown, no title.

"Tell Darian I'll do it," she said.

Cael smiled. It was the smile she'd first seen in a dark mine shaft, offered to a stranger, costing nothing and meaning everything.

She whistled, and Tempest came to her.
