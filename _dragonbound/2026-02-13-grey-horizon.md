Lady Morrow rode into Thornwatch with forty riders and a face carved from the same granite as the keep.

Kira watched from the tower as the woman dismounted in the courtyard. Silver hair pulled back in a warrior's knot. Armor that had seen battles, not ceremonies. Behind her, House Morrow's banner snapped in the wind: a black crow on a white field, flying toward a rising moon.

Darian met his aunt alone. Kira couldn't hear their words, but she watched the tension in his shoulders, the way his hands stayed loose at his sides like a man ready to draw steel.

The parley lasted three hours.

When Darian returned to the war room, his face was unreadable.

"She'll give us supplies. Horses. Maps of the eastern routes." He spread the offerings across the table. "Twenty of her riders will escort us to the Ashland border."

Cael looked up from where Ember was cleaning his scales. "And the price?"

"If we find proof of Varek's murder, she declares for us openly. If we die in the Ashlands, House Morrow never knew we existed."

"Political insurance," Kira said.

"Survival." Darian's jaw tightened. "My aunt loved my mother. She doesn't love Varek. But she has three thousand souls under her protection and no dragons to defend them. She can't gamble their lives on our success."

Kira understood. She'd spent her whole life invisible because visibility meant risk. Lady Morrow was playing the same game at a larger scale.

"When do we leave?"

"Dawn."

They rode east for four days before the green began to die.

The change came slowly at first. Grass thinning. Trees growing twisted and sparse. The sky taking on a yellow tinge that made the sun look sick.

Then, on the fifth morning, Kira woke to find ash on her bedroll.

Not from any fire. The ash simply fell from a grey sky, drifting like snow from a wound in the world.

The Ashlands.

Darian's maps showed the border as a clean line. Reality was messier. The dead zone crept outward in fingers and tendrils, poisoning the land in patterns that made no sense.

"Dragonfire," Darian said when Kira asked. "A thousand years ago, the first bonded lords fought a war here. They burned so hot, so long, that the earth itself died."

Kira looked at the grey horizon stretching endlessly before them. At the skeletal trees and cracked earth and absolute silence.

"Nothing lives here?"

"Nothing should."

They entered anyway.

The hatchlings went first, spreading out in a hunting formation they'd developed without being taught. Tempest took point, his storm-grey scales blending with the ash until he was almost invisible. The others flanked wide, covering approaches that didn't exist in the dead landscape.

Protecting the pack.

Kira felt their unease through the bond. The Ashlands tasted wrong to them, like meat too long in the sun. But they flew on, because she asked them to.

*Trust,* she sent. *I trust you. You trust me.*

Twelve minds settled into watchfulness.

The first attack came at dusk.

Kira didn't see what triggered it. One moment the landscape was empty. The next, shapes were erupting from the ash.

Not animals. Not anything she had words for.

They moved like liquid shadow poured into the suggestion of bodies. Limbs that bent wrong. Heads that split and reformed. Eyes that glowed with the sick yellow of the poisoned sky.

Ashwraiths.

Tempest dove before Kira could give the command. His jaws closed on the first wraith and it came apart like smoke, only to reform around his neck, clawing at his scales with hands made of nothing.

*Fire,* Kira sent. *Burn them back.*

Twelve dragons breathed.

The Ashlands lit up like the war that had created them.

Wraiths screamed in frequencies that scraped the inside of Kira's skull. They burned and reformed and burned again, endless, inexhaustible, dragged from ash that covered everything.

Castellan crashed into the fray, bronze scales cutting through wraiths like a blade through cobwebs. Darian clung to his back, sword drawn, slashing at shapes that his steel couldn't touch.

Cael rode Ember now. The copper-gold dragon had grown large enough to carry him, and they moved together like they'd been practicing for years. Ember's flame burned a different color than the others, pale and pure, and where it touched, wraiths didn't reform.

Kira saw and understood.

*Ember's fire,* she sent to the other hatchlings. *Pattern it. Copy it.*

The command rippled through twelve minds. Within seconds, the flames shifted. Purer. Hotter. The wraiths began to truly die.

By the time full dark fell, the attack had ended.

Kira landed beside Darian, ash coating her hair, her clothes, the scales of every dragon around her.

"You never mentioned those," she said.

"I didn't know." Darian's voice was hoarse. "The histories talk about dangers in the Ashlands. They don't talk about wraiths that hunt by heat and life."

Cael slid from Ember's back, moving stiffly. A gash ran along his arm where something had gotten through.

"They're drawn to the dragons," he said. "To the fire in them. We're prey here."

Kira looked at the grey horizon, at the landscape of endless death stretching between them and the Sanctum of Echoes.

Three weeks of this.

They learned to travel by moonlight.

The wraiths were weaker when the temperature dropped, sluggish and easier to destroy. So they slept through the worst heat of day, huddled in whatever shelter they could find, and moved when the world turned cold.

A week into the Ashlands, Kira stopped counting the attacks. They came every night. Sometimes small swarms. Sometimes waves that took hours to burn through.

The hatchlings grew harder. Leaner. Their flames burned hotter, and their minds sharpened into weapons.

Tempest killed a wraith queen on the eighth night. The creature was twice Castellan's size, a horror of twisted ash and ancient malice that rose from a crater and commanded lesser wraiths like extensions of its body.

He tore its throat out while Kira burned its heart with stolen dragonfire.

When it fell, a thousand wraiths fell with it.

Kira slept fourteen hours after that battle. When she woke, Darian was sitting beside her.

"How did you know?" His voice was quiet. "The queen. How did you know to go for the heart?"

Kira flexed her hand. The dragonmark on her wrist pulsed with warmth.

"Sorrenvex. He fought things like this before. The memories are fuzzy, but they're there."

Darian studied her face. In the ashen light, he looked younger than his armor suggested. Tired in ways that went deeper than muscle.

"You're not what I expected," he said finally. "When I heard about a commoner who'd bonded an ancient dragon, I thought either madwoman or fraud. Instead I find someone who commands twelve hatchlings through a war and never loses her nerve."

"I lose my nerve constantly." Kira pulled herself upright. "I just don't have time to show it."

Something shifted in Darian's expression. A softening.

"My mother used to say that. The difference between courage and cowardice is whether anyone's watching."

Kira met his eyes. Held them.

The moment stretched.

Cael's voice cut through: "Scouts back. The Sanctum's ridge is visible."

Darian stood. The softness vanished behind bronze composure.

But Kira had seen it. And she thought, from the way he paused at the tent entrance, that he'd meant her to.

---

The Sanctum of Echoes rose from the ash like a cathedral built by giants.

Stone towers spiraled toward the grey sky, impossibly tall, impossibly intact after a thousand years. Carved dragons wound around every pillar. Faces watched from every window, eyes following the living with patient interest.

No wraiths attacked as they approached. None had attacked for two days.

"They're afraid of it," Cael said, watching the empty landscape. Ember growled agreement.

"Or it's already claimed by something worse," Darian replied.

Kira walked forward. Her wrist burned hotter with every step, the dragonmark pulling toward the Sanctum like a compass finding north.

The gates stood open.

Beyond them, darkness waited.

Twelve hatchlings spread their wings at Kira's back. Tempest pressed his snout against her shoulder, and through the bond she felt his simple certainty: wherever she went, he would follow.

Kira stepped through the gates.

The Sanctum swallowed her whole.
