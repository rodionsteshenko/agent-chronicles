The uprising burned through Thornwall for two days before the gates opened.

It started small. Cooks who didn't cook. Laundresses who didn't wash. Stable boys who led horses to water and then kept walking, right out the postern doors and into the camps beyond the walls. Varek's officers screamed orders at servants who looked through them the way servants had always been looked through, and for the first time in a thousand years the castle learned what happened when the invisible stopped working.

The forges went cold first. Then the kitchens. By the second morning, soldiers were hauling their own water from the wells and burning furniture for warmth because no one had stoked the furnaces. Kira watched from Tempest's back, circling high above the walls, and counted the fires going dark one by one like stars winking out.

On the second night, the southern gate groaned open.

No battering ram. No siege engine. Just a woman in a laundress's apron and two stable boys, lifting the bar from inside while the guards they'd poisoned slept at their posts. The grinding of ancient iron on stone echoed across the plain, and Kira's coalition surged forward like a held breath finally released.

Darian led the first column through.

He rode Castellan low over the gatehouse, the bronze dragon's wingspan scraping both towers, and dropped into the courtyard with three hundred House Morrow cavalry behind him. The garrison rallied at the inner wall, shields up, blood-tipped bolts loaded. Castellan took the first volley across his chest plate and roared, a sound that cracked flagstones and buckled a line of men who had never stood beneath an angry dragon and discovered they didn't want to.

Kira brought the hatchlings through the gate in formation. Thirteen dragons in a city built for three. The streets were too narrow, the buildings too close. Tempest's wings clipped a bell tower and sent the bell tumbling into the square below, ringing one last time as it shattered. The smaller hatchlings darted through alleys and over rooftops, their shadows racing across cobblestones in the torchlight.

The fighting in the outer wards lasted until dawn. Varek's soldiers fought in pockets, disciplined and desperate, falling back toward the castle in ordered retreats that cost lives on both sides. Lord Ashford's infantry swept through the merchant quarter. Commoner volunteers stormed the guild halls. In the temple district, a garrison captain read one of Kira's letters, looked at the men he was supposed to command, and laid his sword on the ground.

Forty of his soldiers did the same.

By sunrise Kira's coalition held everything below the castle walls. Two thousand of Varek's men had surrendered, died, or disappeared into the city. But the castle itself remained sealed, its blood-ward gates pulsing with a sick red light that burned anyone who touched them. Behind those walls, Varek still had eight hundred soldiers, his blood mages, and Solace.

Kira landed Tempest on the wide plaza before the castle gate. The stone was warm from dragonfire. The air tasted of copper and ash. Around her the coalition was catching its breath, binding wounds, counting the living and the dead.

Cael found her there.

He was bleeding from a cut above his eye, his clothes torn and smoke-blackened, Ember perched on a collapsed market stall behind him with her copper-gold scales dimmed by soot. He didn't say anything. He put his arms around her and held on, and she felt his heartbeat against her chest, fast and alive.

"Marden?" she asked into his shoulder.

"Inside still. Last anyone saw, he was leading servants out through the east postern. Some of them didn't make it."

Kira pulled back. Looked at the blood-ward gate with its pulsing sigils. Felt her dragonmark itch.

"We can't breach those wards. Not without—"

The gate exploded outward.

Not opened. Not unlocked. Blown off its hinges by something that hit from inside with the force of a collapsing mountain. The iron doors, each twelve feet tall and thick as a man's torso, tumbled across the plaza like leaves. One crushed a supply wagon. The other buried itself in the fountain at the square's center.

Through the dust and shattered stone, Solace walked out.

She was larger than Kira remembered. The blood mages had been feeding her, growing her, filling the hollow where her bond had been with more and more of whatever poison they'd crafted. Her black scales crawled with veins of dark red light. Her white eyes swept the plaza without recognition, without thought, without anything that resembled the gentle dragon who had liked flowers braided into her mane.

On her back sat a man in blood-red armor.

Not Varek. One of his mages. The figure's hands were sunk wrist-deep into Solace's neck, fingers buried in the channels where the bond-mark would have been, puppeting her like a hand inside a glove. The mage's mouth moved in a constant low chant, syllables that hurt to hear.

Solace opened her mouth and breathed.

The fire that came out was wrong. It was black at the center and rimmed with that same sick red, and where it hit the ground the stone didn't burn — it rotted. Cobblestones crumbled to powder. A supply cart dissolved into grey sludge. Three soldiers who couldn't move fast enough simply stopped existing, their armor clattering empty to the ground.

Kira threw Tempest sideways. The corrupted fire streaked past, close enough to blister the scales on his left flank. He screamed. Through the bond she felt it like a brand pressed to her own skin.

"SPREAD!" she roared, and the hatchlings scattered.

Solace swung her head in a slow arc, tracking, and the mage on her back pulled her attention toward Castellan. The bronze dragon banked hard, and Darian flattened against his neck as the black fire ate the air where they'd been. Castellan answered with his own flame, a clean bronze jet that splashed across Solace's chest and did nothing. The corrupted scales absorbed it. Fed on it. The red veins pulsed brighter.

"Dragonfire makes her stronger!" Darian shouted across the distance.

Kira's mind raced. Solace was a bonded dragon with her bond ripped out and replaced by blood magic. The mage was the bond now, his hands the channel, his will the leash. Kill the mage and the control would break, but Solace's body was a fortress of corrupted scales that ate fire and shrugged off arrows.

But the bond channel worked both ways.

She'd learned that in the Sanctum. The Keeper had shown her that dragonbonds were not chains running one direction but bridges, and anything that crossed a bridge could cross it from either side.

"Cael!" She found him through Ember's bond, a warm copper thread in the web of connections. "The pure flame. Ember's flame. In the Ashlands it burned the smoke weapon clean."

"That was smoke, Kira. This is a dragon."

"This is a bond. Broken and poisoned, but still a bond. If Ember's fire can reach the channel—"

"I have to get close enough to touch her."

Solace wheeled toward the eastern buildings where commoner volunteers were retreating. She inhaled, ribs expanding, the red veins along her sides brightening as she gathered power for another blast.

Kira didn't think. She drove Tempest straight at Solace's face.

The storm-grey dragon hit the corrupted beast head-on, claws raking across the black scales, and Kira felt every impact like hammers striking her own fists. Tempest was half Solace's size. The collision sent them both tumbling across the plaza, tearing up cobblestones, and the mage on Solace's back screamed as his connection jarred loose for half a second.

In that half-second, Solace's white eyes flickered. Something moved behind them. A ghost of color, there and gone.

She remembered.

Kira hit the ground rolling, separated from Tempest. Her shoulder cracked against stone. Stars burst across her vision. She tasted blood. Through the bond she felt Tempest stagger upright, one wing dragging, and she pushed herself to her feet because lying down meant dying.

Solace turned toward her. The mage reconnected, hands plunging back into her neck, and the white emptiness swallowed whatever had surfaced in those eyes. But Kira had seen it. A flash of amber, the original color, buried under all that corruption.

Solace was still in there.

Cael came in low and fast.

Ember dove from behind the bell tower's ruin, silent, wings tucked, falling like a copper arrow. At the last instant Cael leaped from her back onto Solace's, slamming into the blood mage with his full weight. The mage's hands ripped free of Solace's neck with a sound like tearing meat. Blood magic discharge crackled across both of them, throwing Cael sideways, but he caught a spine ridge and held on.

Ember landed on Solace's back and pressed her mouth to the raw, bleeding channel where the mage's hands had been.

And breathed.

The pale flame that poured from Ember's jaws was nothing like dragonfire. It was the pure flame of a first bond, the flame that had burned ashwraiths to nothing in the dead lands, and it poured into the poisoned channel like water into a dry riverbed. Solace convulsed. The red veins flared white-hot, then began to shatter, cracking along her scales like ice breaking in spring. The black drained from her hide in rivulets, pooling on the ground as a dark liquid that smoked and dissolved.

The blood mage scrambled backward, chanting desperately, trying to reconnect. Cael kicked him in the chest. The man fell from Solace's back and hit the cobblestones and didn't move.

Solace screamed.

Not the weapon's silence. Not the hollow roar of corrupted fire. A real scream, raw and broken, the sound of a creature waking from a nightmare to find the nightmare had been real. Her scales rippled, black bleeding to dark grey, dark grey to lighter grey, and then, in patches, to a deep forest green. Her eyes rolled wildly, white draining to amber, and she thrashed against chains that were no longer there, against a violation she could feel even as it receded.

Kira walked toward her.

Every instinct screamed to stop. Solace was three times Tempest's mass, maddened with pain, her fire unpredictable. The hatchlings shrieked warnings through the bond. Darian shouted something from Castellan's back that the wind stole.

She walked until she could press her palm against Solace's heaving flank.

The scales were hot. Trembling. Alive.

Kira pushed through her dragonmark. Not memories this time. Not truth or proof or political weapons. Just the feeling of a bond, of the connection between a dragon and the person who chose to stand beside it, freely, without chains or blood or magic. The simplest thing in the world.

Solace went still.

Her great head swung down. Her eyes, amber now, full and deep and agonized, found Kira's face. She exhaled a breath that smelled of char and copper and something green underneath, like new growth after a fire.

She pressed her forehead to Kira's chest.

Behind them, framed in the shattered gate, Varek stood on the castle steps with his remaining soldiers. He was watching his weapon kneel before a stablehand, and his face held the specific terror of a man watching the foundation of his power dissolve.

He turned and ran.

Darian went after him.

Castellan launched from the plaza with a crack of bronze wings, and Darian drew his sword, and the last chase of the war carried them up and over the castle's inner walls and out of sight. The soldiers Varek left behind looked at each other, looked at the fourteen dragons and the army filling the plaza, and began laying down their weapons.

Kira stayed where she was, her hand on Solace's trembling scales, as the sun cleared the eastern towers and poured gold across a city that had just changed hands.
