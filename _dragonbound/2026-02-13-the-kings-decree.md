The war bells reached them three days before the riders did.

Kira heard them first through the hatchlings. Twelve minds flinched at a sound carried on wind too far for human ears, a deep iron toll rolling across the eastern hills like thunder that wouldn't stop.

Thornwatch Keep rose from a granite spine overlooking the Divide, the natural border between the kingdom's green heartland and the dry scrub of the eastern marches. Darian had led them here through eight nights of hard travel, the hatchlings growing stronger with each mile until they no longer stumbled on landing.

Now they perched along the keep's broken battlements like gargoyles come to life.

Tempest, the storm-grey one with lightning in his eyes, had grown to the size of a warhorse. The others weren't far behind.

The bells kept tolling.

"Royal summons," Darian said from the tower window. His voice was flat. "My father is dead."

Kira didn't move from the fire. The green hatchling, fully healed since the standing stones, slept curled against her boots.

"The King?"

"He was old. Sick for years." Darian turned from the window. In the firelight his bronze armor looked like cooling metal. "Varek has been regent in all but name for months. Now he doesn't need the pretense."

Cael rose from the corner where he'd been sharpening a blade he'd taken from a dead hunter. The copper-gold hatchling, which they'd started calling Ember, lifted its head from his shoulder.

"The bells mean coronation," Cael said. It wasn't a question.

"They mean war." Darian crossed to the table where maps spread like fallen leaves. "My brother has wanted the throne since we were children. Now he has it. His first act won't be celebration. It will be eliminating threats."

"Kira," Cael said quietly.

"All of us." Darian's finger traced a line on the map. "He'll declare me traitor within the week. Harboring an illegal bonded, consorting with commoners who've touched dragonfire. He'll strip my name, my lands, my bond rights."

Kira stood. The green hatchling chirped in protest.

"Then we run further."

"There is no further." Darian looked at her, and for the first time she saw exhaustion behind the bronze prince's mask. "Beyond the marches lie the Ashlands. Nothing lives there. Nothing can. Varek designed this hunt perfectly. He knew I'd run east because I had allies here. Now he'll seal the border and starve us out."

Two days later, the first army arrived.

Kira watched from the highest tower as five hundred soldiers made camp in the valley below. Their banners showed Varek's silver serpent, newly crowned.

No dragons circled above them.

"He's keeping his bonded lords in reserve," Darian said. "This is a test. See if we'll surrender quietly."

Kira counted the tents. The supply wagons. The siege equipment being assembled with methodical patience.

"And when we don't?"

"Then the dragons come."

That night, Kira flew for the first time.

Not on Castellan. The bronze dragon tolerated her presence but belonged to Darian in a way that went deeper than respect.

Tempest came to her on the broken rampart while the army's campfires flickered below. He pressed his snout against her chest, and through the bond she felt something like eagerness.

*Up,* he sent. *Sky. Now.*

Kira looked at the ground far below, at the soldiers who would kill her on sight, at the world that had decided she was impossible.

She climbed onto Tempest's back.

His scales were hot against her thighs, ridged for grip like he'd been designed to carry riders. When his wings unfurled, they blocked the stars.

The launch wasn't graceful. Tempest threw himself off the tower with more enthusiasm than skill, and Kira's stomach dropped through her spine. Wind tore at her eyes. The keep shrank to a toy.

Then Tempest found the current.

He stopped fighting the air and started riding it, wings tilting, body rolling, climbing in spirals that made the world spin into scattered light.

Kira bent low against his neck and laughed.

Eleven other minds touched hers with longing. She felt them launch from the battlements one by one, felt their clumsy joy as they rose to join Tempest.

Below, the army stirred. Shouts rose. Horns blared.

Twelve dragons circled above the siege camp like nightmares come to remind the kingdom what power meant.

In the morning, the army pulled back two miles.

Darian found Kira on the rampart, still wearing the windburn from her flight.

"You've changed the equation," he said. "Varek wanted to crush a fugitive. Now he has to fight a force."

"Twelve hatchlings aren't an army."

"No." Darian leaned against the stone beside her. Close enough that she could smell leather and smoke. "But they will be. In six months, a year. Varek knows this. He'll throw everything at us before they mature."

"Then we need allies."

"We need legitimacy." Darian turned to face her fully. "My brother will paint you as a monster. A commoner who stole dragonfire, who corrupts the natural order. The noble houses will believe him because believing otherwise means questioning everything they've built their power on."

Kira met his gaze. "So what do we do?"

"We find proof." Darian's voice dropped. "Sorrenvex's memories showed you how my brother killed Lord Aldric. That memory still exists somewhere in your bond. If we can extract it, prove what Varek did, we can turn the houses against him."

"Extract it how?"

"The standing stones cleansed your hatchling of corruption. There are older places like them. Places where memory and magic aren't separate things." Darian pulled a folded map from his belt. "The Sanctum of Echoes. Three weeks east, in the Ashlands. They say it was built by the first dragonbonders, before the bloodlines were established. Before the laws."

Kira looked at the map. At the blank space marked only with old symbols and warnings.

"You want to cross the Ashlands."

"I want to end this war before it becomes a slaughter." Darian's jaw tightened. "My brother has nine bonded lords. We have one bronze dragon and twelve growing hatchlings. Numbers alone, we lose."

Cael appeared on the stairs, Ember riding his shoulder. The bond between them had deepened in recent days. Kira could feel it through her own connection to the copper-gold hatchling, a warmth that wasn't hers.

"Scouts report more riders approaching," Cael said. "Different banners. House Morrow."

Darian's expression shifted. Something like hope, quickly buried.

"My mother's house. They've stayed neutral since she died."

"They're not staying neutral anymore," Cael said. "Forty riders. No siege equipment. They're flying a parley flag."

Below, the hatchlings stirred. Tempest lifted his head and growled low, uncertain.

Kira touched the bond and sent calm.

*Wait,* she told him. *Watch. Learn which ones are prey and which are pack.*

Tempest's growl faded into a rumble of acknowledgment.

The war had found them.

Now they would decide how to fight it.
