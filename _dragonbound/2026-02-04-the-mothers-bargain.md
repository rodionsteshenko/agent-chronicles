The creature rose higher from the magma, revealing a form that hurt to look at. Scales that shifted between every color. Eyes that contained nothing but fire. Wings that had never been meant for air, but for swimming through molten stone.

"Pyreth," Kira heard herself say. The name surfaced from Sorrenvex's memories like a bubble from deep water. "You're Pyreth. The first."

The creature's smile widened, showing teeth like obsidian blades. "The old one remembered me. Good. Then you know what I am."

Behind her, Cael made a strangled sound. "Kira. What is that thing?"

"The mother of dragons." The words tasted like ash. "The first of them all. She laid the original clutch a thousand years ago, then returned to the earth's fire when humans began hunting her children."

"Not hunting," Pyreth corrected. "Enslaving. Twisting the bond into chains." She sank lower in the magma lake, and the chamber trembled. "I watched my children's children become servants to your kings. Leashed. Bred for docility. And I waited."

The mark on Kira's wrist burned white-hot. She unwrapped it with shaking hands, revealing the dragon brand—but it had changed. New lines spiraled outward, forming a pattern she'd never seen in any noble's mark.

"The old one gave you more than memories," Pyreth said. "He gave you his fire. His true fire, not the tame spark your lords permit." Her massive head swung toward a ledge above the magma, where Kira now saw them—twelve eggs, each one the size of a wine barrel, their shells swirling with inner light. "These are my last children. Unbonded. Unbroken. If they hatch under human control, they will become like all the others. Weapons for princes."

"And if they don't?"

"Then dragons might be free again." Pyreth's eyes fixed on Kira. "But they cannot hatch alone. They need a mother's fire to wake them—or a bonded's call." She rose from the lake, magma streaming from her form. "You carry Sorrenvex's flame. You could wake them. The question is: will you?"

Kira's mind raced. Twelve dragons, unbonded. Enough to overthrow every noble house in Valdris. Enough to start a war or end one. She thought of Prince Varek and his soldiers waiting above, of the kingdom that had made her invisible for nineteen years.

"If I wake them," she said slowly, "what happens to me?"

"You become their mother in my place. Bound to all twelve until they are grown." Pyreth's voice softened to something almost gentle. "It will not kill you. But you will never be alone again. Never be free of them."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I sink back into the fire, and my children stay sleeping." The ancient dragon began to descend. "Perhaps another will come in a century or two. Perhaps not. The choice is yours, little hatchling. I cannot make it for you."

Cael grabbed Kira's arm. "Don't. This is madness. You don't even know what those things would—"

A boom echoed through the tunnels. Then another. Men's voices, distant but growing closer.

"They're blasting through the collapsed sections," Cael said, face draining of color. "Varek's soldiers. They must have followed us."

Pyreth laughed, and the chamber shook. "It seems you have less time to decide than I thought. Choose now, child. Or let the prince choose for you."

Kira looked at the eggs. At Cael. At the burning mark on her wrist. Twelve dragons. Twelve lives. A bond that would reshape her existence forever.

Another explosion, closer now. She could hear armored boots on stone.

"How do I do it?" she asked.

Pyreth's smile was ancient and fierce. "Climb. Touch the first egg. And let Sorrenvex's fire flow through you."

Kira was already moving. The ledge was thirty feet up, accessible only by a series of precarious handholds in the volcanic rock. She climbed fast, stone blistering her palms, the heat from the magma lake below pressing against her like a living thing. Cael shouted something, but she couldn't hear him over the roar of her own pulse.

The first soldier emerged from the tunnel as Kira reached the ledge.

He wore Varek's colors and carried a crossbow. His bolt whistled past her ear and shattered against stone. More men poured in behind him, fanning out along the chamber's edge.

"Don't move!" the lead soldier bellowed. "By order of Prince Varek, you are—"

Pyreth rose from the lake like a mountain coming alive.

The soldiers screamed. Half of them fled back into the tunnel. The rest opened fire, bolts plinking uselessly off scales older than their kingdom. Pyreth didn't kill them, Kira noticed. Just drove them back. Buying her time.

She reached the first egg. Its shell was warm and pulsed beneath her hand like a heart. The mark on her wrist flared.

*Wake*, she commanded. *Come to me.*

Fire poured out of her.

Not heat—something deeper. Something that had been sleeping in Sorrenvex for fifty unbonded years, passed to her in his dying breath. It surged through the egg and into the creature within, and Kira felt a mind touch hers. Small. Confused. Hungry.

*Mother?*

The shell cracked.

Kira moved to the second egg, then the third. The soldiers had regrouped, were trying to edge around Pyreth's bulk, but the ancient dragon blocked every path. Below, Cael was climbing now too, some desperate instinct driving him toward her.

Fourth egg. Fifth. Sixth. Each mind that touched hers was different—curious, fierce, timid, wild. They bound to her one after another, their fires weaving together into something vast.

The seventh egg cracked and a head emerged—scales the color of storm clouds, eyes like lightning.

The eighth opened to reveal gold and copper swirls.

By the ninth, Kira was sobbing, overwhelmed by the torrent of new minds flooding into hers. It was too much. Too many. She could feel each of them, feel their hunger and confusion and desperate need for warmth.

Tenth. Eleventh.

Cael reached the ledge just as she touched the final egg. He caught her as her legs buckled, held her upright as the last dragon's mind joined the chorus.

Twelve voices, crying out for her.

Twelve bonds, blazing in her blood.

Below, Pyreth rumbled with something like satisfaction. "It is done."

The eggs were cracking open all around them. Small heads emerged, scales still slick, wings crumpled and new. One nuzzled against Kira's hand. Another climbed up Cael's arm, and he froze, terrified to move.

"Kira." His voice was barely a whisper. "What do we do now?"

She looked at her dragons—twelve hatchlings, each one forbidden, each one worth more than kingdoms. The soldiers had retreated, but they'd return. Varek would send armies.

"Now," she said, strength flooding back as the bonds settled into place, "we run."

Pyreth sank into the magma one final time. "The back tunnels lead to the far side of the range. Two days' walk. By then, they will be strong enough to fly." Her voice echoed as she descended. "Raise them well, little mother. They are the last hope of my kind."

The chamber went dark except for the glow of the magma.

And Kira, carrying the weight of twelve dragons, began to walk.
