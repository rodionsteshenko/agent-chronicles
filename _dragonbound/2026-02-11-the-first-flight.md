The cliff path was barely a path at all.

Kira followed Darian single file, one hand pressed to the rock, the other gripping the scruff of a midnight-scaled twin as it tried to climb her shoulder. Snowmelt slicked the stone. Somewhere below, a river gnawed at the canyon, a constant hiss of cold water and granite.

Behind them, torchlight flickered in the tunnel mouth like an eye opening.

*Run*, Tempest pulsed through the bond, all sharp angles and storm panic.

Darian moved with the stubborn precision of someone who had learned to survive on narrow ledges long before he learned to wear a crown. He didn’t look back. He didn’t waste breath. He just went down, fast, boots finding holds that Kira would never have trusted.

The hatchlings did not understand cliffs.

They tried to leap. They tried to glide. They tried to climb each other. One nearly toppled over the edge, saved only when Cael threw himself flat and caught its tail with both hands, skinning his palms raw against the rock.

Kira hauled the frantic creature back, heart punching at her ribs.

*Mine*, the copper-gold one chirped at Cael, indignant, and clamped its tiny jaws on his sleeve as if to anchor itself to him.

Cael’s face tightened with pain and concentration. He was pale from lack of sleep, from hunger, from the constant low-level terror of being hunted. But his hands stayed gentle, even when the hatchling’s claws dug into him.

They reached the last switchback as the first arrow clattered off stone above.

Darian swore under his breath and broke into a run.

The ledge widened into a shelf of broken shale, and there Castellan waited.

The bronze dragon’s wings were folded tight against his sides, his massive body crouched like a spring. Moonlight caught along his scales and turned them into hammered metal. His eyes found Darian first, then flicked to Kira, and the air thickened with the pressure of an ancient, wary mind.

Not hostile.

Assessing.

Kira felt her twelve bonds surge in response, a chorus of young fires flaring at the presence of an adult. The hatchlings bristled, tiny neck frills rising, smoke curling from nostrils barely big enough to threaten anything larger than a rat.

Castellan exhaled once, controlled. The breath steamed in the cold.

*Easy*, Darian sent, not with words but with the quiet authority of a bonded rider. Castellan’s head lowered a fraction.

The moment of balance held for one heartbeat.

Then the soldiers spilled out onto the cliff above, their torches throwing frantic shadows.

“Prince!” someone shouted. “Hold!”

Darian didn’t answer.

He vaulted onto Castellan’s foreleg and hauled himself up with the ease of familiarity. A rope ladder slapped down the dragon’s side.

“Up,” Darian snapped.

Kira moved because there was no other direction left.

She shoved the twins into the crook of her arm, shoved Tempest up first because Tempest would bite anyone who tried to take him, and climbed. The rope burned her palms. Cael came after, half dragging, half carrying the copper-gold hatchling that refused to release his sleeve.

Arrows hissed past.

One struck Castellan’s shoulder and snapped. Another sank shallow into bronze scale, skittering harmlessly aside.

Castellan rose.

The cliff shelf shuddered as the dragon unfolded his wings. Wind slammed into Kira, the down-draft of something built for war and altitude. The hatchlings shrieked in her mind, a scatter of fear.

Kira wrapped her body around them like a shield.

Castellan leapt.

For a weightless instant, the world dropped away and the canyon opened beneath them, black and endless.

Then the wings caught air.

They shot outward into the night, the dragon’s first powerful strokes pulling them up and away while torches dwindled to sparks on the cliff.

Kira kept her eyes down until the panic in her stomach steadied into something she could breathe through.

Below, the river became a ribbon. Above, the sky was a cold lid studded with stars.

She had never been this high off the ground in her life.

She had never been this visible.

---

They didn’t fly toward the capital.

Darian angled Castellan east, away from roads, away from villages, away from anything that could be questioned or bribed. They followed the spine of the mountains until the peaks softened into forested hills.

Hours passed in chopping wind.

The hatchlings quieted only when exhaustion finally overcame them, their minds slipping into warm, tangled sleep against Kira’s ribs. Their bodies were heavier than they had been yesterday. Their wings, still too small, twitched as if dreaming of air.

Castellan landed just before dawn in a narrow valley where fog pooled like milk.

A ruin stood there: an old watchtower, collapsed in one corner, moss climbing its stones. It looked abandoned, but Kira smelled smoke that was too fresh for history.

Darian slid down first, sword already in his hand.

Kira followed, stiff and shaking, every muscle clenched from clinging to the saddle straps. When her boots hit ground, the simple fact of dirt underfoot nearly made her weep.

The fog parted.

Men stepped out from behind the ruin, bows raised.

Darian lifted his empty hand in a signal that stopped the arrows mid-draw.

Not guards in royal livery.

These wore patched cloaks and mismatched armor. Their faces were hard and tired, the faces of people who had chosen a side and paid for it.

One woman approached, hair braided tight, a scar running from ear to jaw.

She looked at Darian as if she wanted to strike him, embrace him, or both.

Then her gaze dropped to Kira.

To the hatchlings.

The fog seemed to inhale.

Kira felt it too, the moment when the world tips. When something hidden becomes impossible to hide again.

The woman’s eyes widened.

“Stars,” she breathed.

Darian didn’t let the shock linger. He moved, fast, directing people with sharp gestures, putting bodies between the valley and the sky. Castellan folded his wings and crouched low beside the ruin, bronze blending with stone.

Kira was ushered into the broken tower.

Inside, it was warmer. A fire pit smoldered. Dried meat hung from beams. Someone had been preparing for a long stay.

Kira didn’t ask questions.

Her life had become a chain of sprints between disasters.

She set the hatchlings down, and they immediately began to explore the tower like it belonged to them. Tempest climbed a fallen stone and declared it a mountain. One midnight twin curled into the ash pile and purred. The copper-gold one trotted a tight circle around Cael and then pressed its head into his shin as if satisfied he hadn’t vanished in the night.

Cael sank against the wall, eyes half-lidded, and for a moment looked younger than his fear.

Darian unbuckled Castellan’s saddle outside, his movements controlled, but the tightness in his jaw never eased.

Kira watched him through the broken doorway.

He wasn’t kind in the soft way she’d once imagined princes were in stories.

He was kind in the way of someone who did not have the luxury of being gentle.

By midmorning, the valley was alive.

Scouts came and went. The woman with the scar sent runners into the trees. Someone dragged branches to hide Castellan’s landing prints. Someone else smeared ash on their own footprints and walked backward through mud, making the trail look like a retreat.

Kira sat with the hatchlings and learned a new kind of exhaustion.

Mothering dragons was not like feeding horses.

They ate when they wanted. They fought when they were bored. They slept in sudden heaps and woke just as suddenly, all hunger and teeth.

But the bond gave her something steady beneath the chaos.

It told her the shape of each mind.

Tempest, restless and proud.

The twins, linked to each other like two halves of a single flame.

A small green one who flinched at loud sounds.

A red-spotted one who kept trying to bite stones as if it could eat the world.

And under it all, a thrum of growth.

Their bones lengthening.

Their wings thickening.

Their fire deepening.

Kira could feel them changing in real time, as if the world had decided to hurry them along.

Outside, a hawk screamed.

The hatchlings answered.

Their heads snapped up in unison, eyes bright.

And for the first time, Kira felt a collective itch in the bond, like an arm that had fallen asleep and wanted blood back.

*Sky*, Tempest demanded.

Not a word.

A direction.

A need.

Kira stood.

The watchtower’s broken roof opened to a slice of pale blue. Wind whispered through it.

The hatchlings looked up.

Then, as if following a signal only they could hear, they surged for the light.

Kira ran after them.

They spilled out into the valley in a scatter of claws and half-grown wings.

Tempest launched first.

Not a graceful takeoff. A scramble up a boulder, a jump that should have ended in a tumble.

But the air caught him.

He dropped six feet, panic flaring through the bond, and then his wings found their rhythm. One hard beat. Another.

He rose.

A foot.

Two.

Then he was circling above the valley, clumsy and triumphant, lightning eyes bright as coins.

The others followed.

Some failed and crashed into brush. Some leapt and only managed a glide. Two got tangled together and thumped into a snowbank in a heap of offended hissing.

But one by one, they found it.

The sky.

The hatchlings’ minds lifted with their bodies, and Kira felt it like her own chest cracking open.

For years she had been confined to stone corridors and stable walls.

Now twelve pieces of her were airborne.

Darian came out of the trees at a run, sword still in hand, then stopped dead as he saw them.

Castellan lifted his head and watched, silent.

Cael stumbled after, and when the copper-gold hatchling finally caught air, it didn’t fly far.

It looped once, then came down and landed on his shoulder with a clumsy, pleased thump.

Cael swayed under the sudden weight, laughing without meaning to.

The sound startled him as much as anyone else.

Kira saw the scarred woman stare up at the sky with something like dread.

Not because dragons were frightening.

Because dragons meant power.

And power drew eyes.

Kira felt it too.

Somewhere beyond the hills, beyond the roads, beyond the capital she’d fled, a thread tightened. A pressure like distant thunder.

Varek.

Not a voice.

A consequence.

The hatchlings climbed higher.

Tempest screamed his joy into the wind.

And Kira understood, with a clarity that tasted like iron, that there would be no hiding now.

Not for her.

Not for Darian.

Not for anyone standing in this valley beneath twelve new shadows.
