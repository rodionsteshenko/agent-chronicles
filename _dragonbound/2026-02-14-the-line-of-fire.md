They crossed the Ashlands in two days.

The return journey was faster than the approach. The ashwraiths that had harried them on the way in gave wide berth now, repelled by something in the hatchlings that hadn't existed before. Their fire burned differently since the Sanctum. Cleaner. Older. As if the blue light in those ancient walls had seeped into their bones and taught their flames a language forgotten by the living world.

Kira rode Tempest at the head of the formation. The storm-grey dragon had grown again during their three days in the Sanctum, his wingspan nearly matching Castellan's, his eyes crackling with pale lightning even in rest. She could feel the others arrayed behind her through the web of their bond: Ember glowing copper-gold against Cael's back, the jade twins banking left to scout, the white one they'd named Ghost drifting silently at the rear.

Below, Darian rode Castellan with the Keeper's sealed scroll strapped across his chest in a leather case.

Nobody spoke much. There wasn't much left to say.

On the second evening, they crested a ridge of volcanic glass and saw the army.

It sprawled across the border where grey ash met green earth, a city of tents and banners stretching two miles along the tree line. Cookfires bled smoke into the twilight. Horse lines, siege equipment, supply wagons. The three noble dragons circled in slow holding patterns above the encampment, their scales catching the last light: one red, one silver, one dark blue nearly black.

Thousands of soldiers. Three bonded lords. The full weight of Varek's new kingdom, assembled to crush a stablehand and her stolen dragons.

Kira's hands tightened on Tempest's neck ridge.

*Steady,* he pushed into her mind. Not words exactly. The feeling of storm clouds holding their rain, waiting for the moment.

"There." Darian pointed east. A separate cluster of tents flew the grey-and-gold banner of House Morrow, positioned deliberately apart from Varek's main force. Lady Morrow had come. She was watching.

"We go straight to them?" Cael asked.

"No." Kira shook her head. "We go to everyone."

They descended at dawn.

Twelve dragons and Castellan dropped through the cloud layer in a diamond formation that Kira had drilled during the crossing. The hatchlings had grown ferociously in the Ashlands. Weeks of wraith combat and volcanic thermals had hardened them into something that no longer fit the word "hatchling." They were adolescents now, lean and sharp and radiating heat that made the air ripple around them.

The army saw them first as shadows. Then as shapes. Then as an impossibility.

Horns blew across the encampment. Soldiers scrambled. The three noble dragons broke their lazy circles and dropped into attack stances, riders shouting commands.

Kira didn't slow down.

She brought Tempest to ground in the open field between Varek's army and House Morrow's camp, exactly on the border where ash met grass. The other dragons landed around her in a rough semicircle, wings folding, necks raised, thirteen sets of eyes watching thirteen directions.

The silence that followed was absolute.

Then the army parted, and Prince Varek rode through on a white horse.

He looked nothing like his brother. Where Darian was all angles and restless energy, Varek carried his power like a man who had never doubted he deserved it. Silver hair cropped close. Armor that had been forged for a king, because he was one now. The thin crown of Valdris sat on his brow as if it had always been there.

Behind him rode Lord Cassian on the red dragon, Lord Vellant on the silver, and Lord Ashford on the dark blue. Three bonded nobles, each with decades of experience and dragons three times the size of Kira's brood.

Varek stopped fifty yards out. His eyes moved across the dragons, counting, assessing. When they reached Kira, sitting astride Tempest in her ash-stained clothes with no armor and no crown, something flickered in his expression.

Not fear. Recognition. He knew what she represented.

"The criminal Kira," he called, his voice carrying the trained projection of a man raised to address crowds. "Wanted for the theft of royal property, the corruption of dragon eggs, and the murder of Head Keeper Marden."

"Marden's alive," Kira said flatly. "He's selling information about me from a tavern in Millhaven. You know that."

A ripple through the front ranks. Soldiers glancing at each other.

Varek continued as if she hadn't spoken. "You will surrender the dragons to the Crown, submit to trial, and—"

"No."

The word cut the air. Tempest rumbled beneath her, a subsonic vibration that made the ground tremble.

Castellan landed behind Kira's line. Darian dismounted and walked forward until he stood beside Tempest's shoulder, his bronze armor dulled by ash but his bearing unmistakable.

"Brother." Varek's composure cracked for exactly one second. "You've been declared traitor to the throne."

"By the man who murdered his way onto it." Darian's voice was iron. "I have proof, Varek. Testimony from the Keeper of Echoes, whose seal hasn't been seen in five centuries. And something else."

He looked at Kira.

She had practiced this in the Sanctum until the technique lived in her muscles. She raised her marked wrist. Drew on Sorrenvex's memory. Fed it to Tempest through their bond.

Tempest opened his jaws and breathed.

Not flame. Not heat. Light.

The dragonfire erupted in a curtain of blue-white brilliance that stretched thirty feet high and fifty feet wide, hanging in the air like a living painting. Inside it, shapes formed with crystalline clarity.

Lord Aldric's study. The candles. The letter half-written on the desk.

The army watched, paralyzed, as Prince Varek walked through a dead man's door carrying two glasses of wine.

*"A drink, my lord."*

The memory played in silence except for the voices, carried in flame, unmistakable. Aldric accepting the glass. Sipping. The cough. The collapse. And Varek standing over the body, taking the letter from dying fingers.

*"Bonds break when hearts stop. And hearts stop so easily."*

The image dissolved.

The silence that followed was worse than any battle cry.

Kira saw it spread through the army like plague. Soldiers who had marched here believing they served a rightful king now staring at the man on the white horse with different eyes. Officers exchanging glances. The three noble lords pulling their dragons back, reins tight, faces unreadable.

And Varek.

His composure didn't break. That was the terrifying part. He watched his own crime play out in dragonfire for five thousand witnesses and his expression settled into something beyond anger. Calculation. He was already thinking three moves ahead, already reshaping the board.

"Clever," he said quietly. Then, louder: "Dragon illusions prove nothing. Any blood mage can fabricate memories in flame. Lord Cassian, Lord Vellant, take the traitors."

The red dragon surged forward.

Kira didn't give the command. She didn't need to.

Tempest launched skyward with a crack of displaced air that knocked soldiers flat. The eleven others followed in a rolling thunder of wingbeats, and the sky above the border became a war.

Lord Cassian's red was old and massive, a veteran of border skirmishes and tournament displays. It dove at Tempest with jaws wide and flame building in its throat.

The jade twins hit it from both sides.

They were half its size but twice its speed, spiraling in coordinated arcs that Kira felt through the bond like fingers of her own hands. Their fire wasn't aimed to kill. It struck the red dragon's wing joints, the sensitive spots between scales, driving it off course. Castellan swept in from below and locked claws with the red, the two great dragons tumbling through the air in a grinding embrace.

The silver dragon went for the hatchlings on the ground. Lord Vellant was smarter than Cassian, targeting the smallest of Kira's brood. Ghost, the white one, barely evaded the first pass, rolling aside as silver fire scorched the grass where she'd stood.

Ember answered.

The copper-gold dragon had been quiet since the Sanctum, staying close to Cael. Now she rose with flame already streaming from her jaws, that pure fire she'd first shown against the ashwraiths. It hit the silver dragon's flank and the beast screamed, veering off. Not burned. Purified. Whatever artificial reinforcement the blood mages had woven into the noble bond flickered and sparked under Ember's flame like wet wood refusing to catch.

Lord Ashford held back. His dark blue dragon circled high, watching. Waiting.

On the ground, Cael had drawn a sword he'd taken from Thornwatch Keep and stood with four hatchlings around him, guarding the space where Kira had projected the memory. Darian fought toward the Morrow camp, cutting through soldiers who seemed more confused than committed.

Because the army was fracturing.

Kira could see it from Tempest's back as they rolled through a banking turn. Whole companies standing down, lowering weapons, watching the sky battle with the stunned expressions of men who had just seen their king commit murder in dragonfire. Officers arguing. A cavalry unit wheeling away from the field entirely, their captain apparently deciding this wasn't his fight anymore.

And from the east, a horn.

House Morrow's banner rose. Grey and gold, snapping in the wind. Lady Morrow's cavalry poured from between her tents in disciplined lines, not charging Varek's army but inserting themselves between the fracturing loyalists and Kira's position. A wall of horse and steel and political commitment.

Lady Morrow had chosen.

Kira pulled Tempest around and dove.

She came in low over the field, Tempest's wingtips nearly brushing the helmets of stunned soldiers. Another burst of memory-fire: Varek's face as Aldric died, played again, impossible to deny, impossible to unsee.

The red dragon broke free of Castellan and retreated. Lord Cassian was bleeding from a gash on his forehead, his dragon favoring one wing. They didn't re-engage.

The silver followed.

Lord Ashford's dark blue dragon descended slowly, landed before Varek's position, and folded its wings. Lord Ashford dismounted. Walked to where the other lords had gathered. Said something Kira couldn't hear.

Then he turned his back on the king.

Varek sat on his white horse in the center of a collapsing kingdom. Half his army had stopped fighting. One of his three dragon lords had openly defected. The proof of his crime hung in the air like smoke that wouldn't clear.

He looked at Kira.

She hovered on Tempest, sixty feet up, twelve dragons arrayed behind her like a crown of wings and fire.

"This isn't over," Varek said. Not shouting. Speaking at a volume meant only for her, carried on the wind between them. "You think truth matters? Truth has never ruled this kingdom. Power has. And I will burn every commoner village between here and the capital before I let a stablehand sit where I sit."

He turned his horse and rode back through his fragmenting army.

Within the hour, the loyalists separated from the undecided. Varek took perhaps two thousand soldiers, Lord Cassian's wounded dragon, Lord Vellant's silver, and retreated west toward the capital in tight formation. The rest milled in confusion until House Morrow's officers began directing them to lay down arms.

Kira landed in the trampled grass where the battle had begun.

Her hands were shaking. She pressed them flat against Tempest's warm scales until the trembling stopped.

Cael reached her first. He had a cut on his cheek that he didn't seem to notice. Ember nuzzled Kira's shoulder, and for a moment the bond between all of them, hatchlings, riders, dragons, pulsed with something that felt like a single heartbeat.

"You did it," Cael said. His golden-flecked eyes were bright.

"Not yet." Kira watched the dust cloud of Varek's retreat. "He still has the capital. He still has the throne. And he just promised to burn everything between here and there."

Darian arrived with Lady Morrow at his side. The old noblewoman looked at Kira with an expression that mixed respect with something harder, the recognition that the world she'd known was ending.

"My lady." Kira straightened. "House Morrow declared. I won't forget it."

"See that you don't." Lady Morrow's gaze moved across the twelve dragons. "The murder proof will bring more houses to our side. But the other truth, about the bonds, about commoners..." She paused. "That truth will burn hotter than dragonfire, girl. Every noble in the kingdom will fear you."

"Good," Kira said. "They should."

She looked west, where Varek's column raised dust against the setting sun. He was retreating to a city of a hundred thousand souls, to stone walls and loyal guards and the blood mages who had built his family's power on a lie.

She would follow. Not today, not tomorrow. But soon.

Tempest pressed his mind against hers. Certainty. Storm. The feeling of lightning about to strike.

Kira climbed onto his back and rose above the field, above the surrendering soldiers and the Morrow banners and the aftermath of a battle that had changed the shape of the world.

Below her, for the first time in the history of Valdris, commoners looked up at a dragonrider and saw one of their own.
