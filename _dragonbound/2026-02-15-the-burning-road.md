The first village burned on the third day of the march.

They smelled it before they saw it. Kira was riding Tempest above the vanguard, scanning the patchwork of farmland that stretched toward the capital, when the wind shifted and carried the unmistakable tang of charred thatch and something worse beneath it. Livestock. Grain stores. A season's worth of survival turned to carbon.

Tempest banked hard without being asked, dropping through a layer of low cloud. Below, the village of Harren's Cross was a skeleton. Every structure gutted. The mill collapsed into its own foundation, the granary a smoldering crater. Bodies of cattle lay bloated in the fields. The well had been poisoned; even from altitude Kira could see the dark stain around its mouth.

No human bodies. That was something. The villagers had fled or been driven out before the torches came.

Varek was keeping his promise.

She landed in the square and walked through the ruins while the hatchlings spread across the perimeter, alert, restless. The fire was hours old but still hot in places, radiating through the soles of her boots. A child's wooden horse lay half-burned in the doorway of a cottage. She picked it up. Set it on the remains of a wall.

Cael landed beside her on Ember. He didn't say anything. He didn't need to.

By the time the column caught up, Kira had counted the damage: forty-two homes, a mill, a granary, a smithy, and a small temple to the old river gods. An entire community erased in an afternoon by soldiers who would never learn the names of the people they'd displaced.

Lady Morrow surveyed the destruction from horseback, her face carved from the same stone as the ruined walls. "He'll do this to every settlement between here and the capital. Deny you shelter, deny you supply, deny you the loyalty of the common people by making them fear what your presence brings."

"Then we move faster," Kira said.

---

They moved faster.

The coalition had swelled to nearly four thousand in the days since the Ashland border. Surrendered soldiers who chose amnesty over desertion. Morrow cavalry, disciplined and well-supplied. A contingent from Lord Ashford's holdings, riding hard to catch up after their lord's defection. And something new, something that made the noble officers uneasy: commoners.

They came in ones and twos at first. Farmers who had watched twelve dragons cross the sky above their fields. A blacksmith from a market town who brought his apprentices and a cartload of arrowheads. Three sisters from a fishing village who knew the river crossings better than any map. They didn't come with weapons or training. They came because they had seen a girl without a family name ride a dragon, and that single image had cracked something open in the bedrock of what they believed was possible.

Kira accepted every one of them.

Darian argued against it, the first real argument they'd had. "Untrained civilians will slow the march and die in the first engagement," he said, pacing the command tent while maps curled on the table between them. Castellan rumbled agreement from outside, his bronze tail sweeping the grass flat.

"They're not soldiers," Kira agreed. "But they're the reason we're doing this. If we turn them away, what exactly are we fighting for?"

The silence that followed told her she'd won.

She organized the civilians into supply trains and scout networks. The fishing sisters mapped every ford and bridge within thirty miles. The blacksmith set up a traveling forge that rang from dusk to midnight. Commoners who knew the land became the coalition's eyes, ranging ahead of the cavalry on farm horses and mules, bringing back reports of burned villages and troop movements faster than any noble scout.

Darian watched this happening with an expression she couldn't quite read. Admiration, maybe. Or the dawning recognition that the world he'd been raised in was already over, and the woman dismantling it slept thirty feet from his tent every night.

The second village burned on the fifth day. The third on the sixth.

By the eighth day of the march, they had passed through seven destroyed settlements. Varek's retreating forces were methodical: they burned the granaries first, then the mills, then the wells. They left the houses standing sometimes, as if to say *you can have the walls, but nothing that sustains life within them*. It was a strategy designed to turn the countryside against Kira. Every burned village was a message: *this is what happens when a stablehand plays at war.*

It had the opposite effect.

The refugees didn't scatter. They joined the column. Families with nothing left loaded whatever they could carry onto handcarts and fell in behind the cavalry, a growing river of displaced humanity that stretched a mile behind the main force. They didn't blame Kira. They blamed the king who burned their homes.

On the ninth night, camped in a river valley with scouts reporting the capital less than four days ahead, a delegation of refugee elders approached Kira's fire.

The oldest was a woman named Sorrel, seventy if she was a day, who had lost two houses to two different wars and had the patience of someone who understood that kingdoms burned but people endured. She carried a clay pot sealed with wax.

"Seeds," she said, setting it at Kira's feet. "Winter wheat, barley, three kinds of turnip. Saved from Harren's Cross before the soldiers came." She straightened with effort. "You plant them in whatever comes next."

Kira took the pot. It was heavier than it looked.

"I will," she said.

Two nights later, Cael kissed her.

It wasn't dramatic. No moonlight revelation, no battlefield confession. They were sitting on a flat rock above the camp, watching the hatchlings settle into their sleeping formation, a tangle of wings and tails that pulsed with shared warmth. Ember lay apart from the others, her copper-gold scales dim in the darkness, her head resting on Cael's knee.

They had been talking about nothing. The temperature of the river. Whether Ghost was growing faster than the others. The way Tempest's lightning-eyes flickered when he dreamed.

Then Cael turned to her and said, "I've been trying to figure out the right time for this and I've decided there isn't one," and kissed her.

His lips were warm. His hand found the back of her neck, fingers sliding into her hair, and through the bond she felt Ember stir, a ripple of copper light that meant *finally*. The other hatchlings shifted in their sleep. Tempest opened one eye, regarded them with the dragon equivalent of mild interest, and closed it again.

Kira pulled back first. Not because she wanted to.

"The timing is terrible," she said.

"I know."

"We're marching on a fortified capital in three days."

"I know."

"And Darian—"

"Darian is a prince," Cael said quietly. His golden-flecked eyes held hers without flinching. "I'm nobody. Same as you. That's why this works."

She kissed him again. Harder this time, her fingers gripping the front of his shirt, and the bond between them, not just dragon-bond but something older and simpler, hummed like a plucked string finding its note.

They stayed on the rock until the stars wheeled overhead and the camp below fell silent. They didn't talk about what came next. There would be time for that, or there wouldn't.

The capital announced itself from twenty miles out.

Kira flew high on Tempest, above the clouds, and saw it spread across the river basin like a wound. Thornwall. A hundred thousand souls behind walls that had stood for six centuries, anchored by a castle carved from the living rock of a river bluff. Dragon roosts studded the highest towers like the nests of monstrous birds. Smoke rose from a thousand chimneys.

And above it, circling in tight defensive patterns: Cassian's red dragon and Vellant's silver. Two noble dragons against thirteen. The odds should have been laughable.

But the walls changed everything.

Varek had spent his retreat well. The outer gates were sealed with iron and stone. Ballistae lined the parapets, their bolts tipped with the dark gleam of blood-magic alloy. Trenches had been dug in concentric rings outside the walls, bristling with sharpened stakes. The river approach was blocked by a chain stretching between two fortified towers.

He didn't need to win in the field. He only needed to hold.

"He's daring us to siege," Darian said when they gathered in the command tent. The map of Thornwall spread across the table showed a city designed by paranoid architects across generations, each layer harder than the last. "A siege of Thornwall has never succeeded. The river supplies fresh water. The granaries hold six months of food. And his blood mages..."

He trailed off. They all knew about the blood mages.

Lady Morrow tapped a finger on the southern gate. "He has two thousand soldiers. We have four thousand and growing. But those walls were built to withstand ten times that number."

"We're not going to siege it," Kira said.

Every head in the tent turned toward her.

"We're not going to burn it either." She looked at the map, at the tight streets and close-packed houses where a hundred thousand people lived their lives. "Most of those people didn't choose Varek. They're trapped behind his walls. Commoners. Workers. The people I came from."

She reached into her belt pouch and pulled out a sealed letter she'd written that morning. The Keeper of Echoes' testimony, copied three times in Kira's careful hand, with the original seal reproduced in wax that the hatchlings had heated with their breath.

"We send this in first. The truth about the bonds. That commoners were the original dragonbonders. That everything the noble houses built is founded on blood magic and stolen heritage."

Silence.

"You'll lose the noble allies," Lady Morrow said flatly. "Ashford will leave. Half my own house will rebel."

"Maybe." Kira set the letters on the map. "Or maybe they'll realize that a kingdom built on a lie was always going to fall, and the only question is whether they're standing on it when it does."

Darian was watching her with that unreadable expression again. Not a prince assessing a strategy. Something more complicated than that.

"How do we get the letters inside?" he asked.

Kira smiled. It was the smile of a girl who had spent her entire life being invisible, moving through noble corridors and dragon pens without anyone noticing she was there.

"I know every servant's passage in that castle," she said. "Every kitchen entrance, every laundry chute, every drainage tunnel that the nobles don't know exists. Varek sealed the gates. He didn't seal the cracks."

She looked at the map of the city where she'd been invisible for nineteen years.

"I'm going in."
