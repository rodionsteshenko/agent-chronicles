"Stars preserve us. Do you have any idea what you've done?"

Marden's voice cracked on the last word. The torch in his hand trembled, sending shadows dancing across Sorrenvex's still form. The great dragon looked smaller in death, somehow. Diminished.

Kira's mouth opened, but nothing came out. Her wrist throbbed with each heartbeat, the mark burning like a fresh brand. She clamped her other hand over it instinctively, hiding it, though Marden had already seen.

Had already seen *everything*.

"I didn't—" she tried again. "He just—I was only—"

"Talking to him." Marden's face had gone the color of old ash. "I *told* you not to talk to him. I told you he was dangerous."

"He was dying!"

"And now he's dead, and you're—" Marden stopped. Swallowed. His eyes dropped to her covered wrist, and something shifted in his expression. Fear, yes. But something else underneath it. Something calculating.

The silence stretched between them like a wire about to snap.

"Please," Kira whispered. "Marden, please. I don't know what happened. I don't know why he—"

"Be quiet." His voice had changed. Harder now. The trembling had stopped. "Let me think."

He moved into the cavern, circling Sorrenvex's body with the careful steps of a man approaching a cliff's edge. Checking, Kira realized. Making sure the dragon was truly dead. Making sure there were no other witnesses.

They were alone. Deep in the pens, in a cavern most handlers feared to enter. No one would come looking for hours. Maybe days.

"You know what they'll do to you," Marden said quietly. He wasn't looking at her anymore. "If anyone finds out."

Kira's stomach turned to ice. She knew. Every child in Valdris knew. The punishment for a commoner attempting to bond with a dragon was death. Not a clean death, either. The noble houses had made examples throughout history—public executions designed to remind the lowborn of their place.

"It wasn't my choice," she said. "He did it. I didn't ask—"

"You think that matters?" Marden laughed, a bitter sound that echoed off stone. "A servant girl, bonded to a royal-line dragon? They won't care about the how. They'll care about the what. About the threat."

Threat. The word hung in the air between them.

Because he was right. A bonded dragon couldn't be transferred to another rider while the first still lived. Sorrenvex was—had been—of the royal bloodline. His rider should have been a prince. Instead, his bond had gone to...

To her. A stablehand with no name.

"The princes will want you dead before dawn," Marden continued, almost conversationally. "Both of them. You're a complication neither can afford. Unless—"

He turned to face her, and the calculating look had grown into something worse.

"Unless one of them gets to you first. Controls you. Uses you." His eyes dropped to her wrist again. "That bond doesn't just mean you're a threat, girl. It means you're *valuable*. To the right buyer."

Cold clarity cut through Kira's panic. She'd known Marden for seven years. He'd ignored her, dismissed her, occasionally tossed her the least desirable tasks because she was invisible and wouldn't complain. But he'd never looked at her like this before.

Like she was something to be sold.

"I should call the guard," he said slowly. "That's protocol. Dragon death, suspicious circumstances. Should have someone here within the hour."

An hour. Less, probably. And then questions, inspections, her wrist bared for all to see—

"But." Marden held up a finger. "I'm a practical man. And you've always been a good worker. Reliable. *Invisible*." He smiled, showing teeth. "I think there might be a more... profitable arrangement. For both of us."

The memories Sorrenvex had given her were still settling, fragments surfacing at random like debris after a shipwreck. Most were images, sensations, impossible to parse. But one piece rose now with perfect clarity: a face. Young, cruel, with the silver hair of the royal line.

Prince Varek. The elder prince. The one the court whispered was already making deals with the noble houses, positioning himself for the throne.

The same face she'd seen in Sorrenvex's memory of Lord Aldric's murder. Standing in the doorway as the old lord choked on poisoned wine.

Kira's breath caught.

Marden was still talking, something about contacts in the underground markets, about how much a bonded servant might be worth to the right faction. But she'd stopped listening.

She knew who had killed Lord Aldric. She knew where twelve dragon eggs were hidden. And she knew, with sudden terrible certainty, that if Prince Varek learned what was in her head, he would burn the information out of her skull and feed what remained to the dogs.

"—think about it logically," Marden was saying. "You can't run. You have nothing. No money, no connections, no—"

"I need water."

He blinked. "What?"

"Water." Kira made her voice small. Shaky. It wasn't hard. "Please. I feel like I'm going to be sick. There's a cistern in the upper passage. I just need—"

Marden stared at her for a long moment. Then he sighed, the way he always sighed when servants made inconvenient requests.

"Fine. Stay here. Don't touch anything." He turned toward the entrance, torch held high. "And don't think about running. I know every exit in these pens. You wouldn't make it ten steps."

His footsteps receded up the passage. The light faded with him.

Kira counted to five. Then she moved.

Not toward the main entrance—Marden was right about that. She'd never make it past the outer pens without being seen. But Sorrenvex's memories had shown her something else. A passage behind the stone where the old dragon had made his final bed. A route the handlers had forgotten centuries ago, bricked over and abandoned.

Her fingers found the seam in the rock. Pushed. Something shifted, grinding, and a section of wall swung inward on ancient hinges.

Cold air rushed out, carrying the smell of deep earth and something else—something that might have been smoke, or might have been memory.

Kira looked back once at Sorrenvex's body. In the darkness, she could almost imagine his eye still held a faint golden glow.

*Find the clutch. Choose the worthy. Burn the rot from Valdris.*

"I will," she whispered. "I promise."

Then she stepped into the darkness, and the stone swung shut behind her.

The passage was narrow enough that her shoulders brushed both walls, and so dark that she had to navigate by touch alone. Kira moved as quickly as she dared, one hand trailing along the rough stone, the other clutching the fabric she'd torn from her sleeve to wrap around the dragon mark. It still burned, a constant reminder of what she'd become.

What she'd been made into.

The memories kept surfacing. A sun-drenched courtyard where young dragons learned to fly. The taste of deer blood, hot and sweet, after a successful hunt. The face of Lord Aldric, lined with age but still kind, still *good*, in a way the current court had forgotten goodness could look.

And beneath it all, the map. The route to the hidden eggs. Sorrenvex had made sure she couldn't forget that even if she wanted to.

The passage angled upward. Kira climbed, her legs burning, her lungs aching. She had no plan beyond *away*. Away from Marden. Away from the pens. Away from the castle entirely, if she could manage it.

But then what?

The question circled in her head like a carrion bird. She had no money. No allies. No skills beyond caring for dragons—and that particular talent was now a death sentence. The mark on her wrist would identify her to anyone who knew what to look for, and after tonight's death toll...

Everyone would know what to look for.

The passage ended at another sealed section of wall. This one was harder to find the mechanism for, and when Kira finally pushed it open, she was surprised to find not darkness but dim moonlight.

She was outside. On a hillside above the castle, judging by the lights below. The dragon pens were somewhere beneath her feet, and beyond them, the sprawl of the capital city. Valdris. Home to a hundred thousand souls, all of them belonging to the noble houses in one way or another.

All of them potential enemies now.

Kira sank to her knees in the cold grass and let herself shake. Just for a moment. Just long enough to acknowledge how completely her life had shattered.

Then she stood up, pulled her torn sleeve tighter around her marked wrist, and started walking.

She had no idea where she was going. But Sorrenvex had chosen her for a reason. Had waited fifty years for her. And somewhere in this kingdom, twelve dragon eggs were waiting too.

She would find them. She would figure out what to do next.

And if the princes of Valdris came for her—well.

She was bonded to a dragon now. Even a dead one.

That had to count for something.
