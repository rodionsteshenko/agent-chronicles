*Yes.*

The word echoed through Kira's skull like a bell struck in an empty cathedral. She pressed her palms against the cold stone, trying to anchor herself to something real, something that made sense.

"That's not—you can't—" Her voice came out strangled. "I'm not noble-born. The bond requires blood magic. Rituals. There are *rules*."

Another sound from Sorrenvex, something that might have been laughter if dragons could laugh. It rumbled through the cavern and into her bones.

*Rules made by frightened men who found power and hoarded it. The bond exists between dragon and worthy soul. Nothing more.*

Kira's hands were shaking. She'd heard stories, of course—every child in Valdris grew up on tales of the First Bonding, when dragons chose their partners from among all peoples, noble and common alike. But those were legends. Fairy stories. The blood magic that bound dragon to rider had been refined over three centuries specifically to ensure only the right families could claim that power.

"Why me?" she whispered.

Sorrenvex's great head lowered until his eye was level with her face. This close, she could see the cataracts filming his vision, the way his breath came in labored wheezes. He was dying. Had been dying for years, she realized now. Holding on through sheer will.

*Because you listened. Because you see us as more than weapons or status symbols. Because you have fire in you, girl, and nowhere to burn.*

The golden light in his eye began to pulse. Kira felt something shift in the air—a pressure building, like the moment before a storm breaks.

*I am old. I am tired. But I will not let my memories die with me. Aldric's secrets. The truth about the Sundering. The location of the clutch.*

"The clutch?" Kira's heart stuttered. "The hidden eggs? They're real?"

*Twelve eggs. Twelve dragons. Hidden where the usurpers will never think to look.* His mental voice was growing fainter, like someone shouting across an ever-widening chasm. *Aldric and I were searching for a worthy keeper when he was murdered. I have waited fifty years for another.*

"I can't—I'm no one—"

*You are exactly who you need to be. Invisible. Overlooked. The piece no one sees moving across the board until it's too late.*

The pressure broke.

Kira screamed as something *flooded* into her mind—not words now, but images, sensations, entire lifetimes compressed into heartbeats. She saw Valdris from above, the castle a toy beneath her wings. She felt the joy of the hunt, the heat of dragonfire building in her chest, the bone-deep satisfaction of a perfect dive. She saw a young man with silver-streaked hair laughing as he climbed onto her—no, onto *Sorrenvex's*—back. Aldric. Lord Aldric the Elder, fifty years dead.

She saw him die, too. Poison in his wine. The taste of betrayal as he gasped his last breath while Sorrenvex roared and raged against chains that shouldn't have been able to hold him.

She saw faces. Conspirators. Names she recognized from current court proceedings, older now but unmistakable.

And beneath it all, burning like an ember in her chest—a map. A route through passages she'd never known existed, leading to a chamber carved from living rock where twelve eggs sat in perfect rows, waiting.

The flood stopped.

Kira found herself on hands and knees, gasping, tears streaming down her face. Every muscle in her body trembled. Her wrist *burned*.

She looked down.

Where bare skin had been moments before, a mark now wound around her wrist like a brand—scales and flames intertwined, purple-black against her brown skin. The dragon mark. The proof of bonding that every noble-born rider wore.

"No," she breathed. "No, no, no—"

*Yes.* Sorrenvex's voice was barely a whisper now. *You carry my fire now, little one. My memories. My vengeance.*

"I can't hide this. They'll kill me. They'll—"

*They will try.*

She looked up at him. His eyes had gone dim, the golden light fading. But his massive head lifted one last time, and she felt something like warmth flow through the new bond between them—affection, pride, and an ancient, terrible hope.

*Find the clutch. Choose the worthy. Burn the rot from Valdris.*

His head lowered to the stone.

*And when the princes come for you—and they will—remember that you chose this. The fire chose you back.*

The golden light went out.

Kira knelt alone in the darkness, the mark burning on her wrist, three centuries of secrets lodged in her skull, and the weight of twelve unborn dragons settling onto her shoulders.

Above her, somewhere in the castle, a bell began to toll. The dragon keepers' signal.

A royal dragon had died.

And in the chaos that would follow, a stablehand with no name would need to disappear—before anyone noticed the impossible mark she now wore.
