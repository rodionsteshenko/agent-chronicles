She went in through the sewers at moonrise.

The drainage grate on the southern bank had been old when Kira was still scrubbing stable floors, its iron bars corroded to the thinness of finger bones. She and Cael pried two loose in silence, the river masking the sound, and slipped into the darkness beneath Thornwall's walls.

The tunnels were worse than she remembered. Three years of neglect had thickened the air to something almost solid, and the water ran ankle-deep where it had once been dry. But the route was seared into her body the way a horse remembers the path to its stable. Left at the collapsed junction. Under the bridge support where the stones wept moss. Up the carved steps that the architects had never put on any map because the architects hadn't built them. Servants had, centuries ago, because servants always found the ways that power forgot to close.

Cael moved behind her without speaking. Ember had stayed with the hatchlings outside the walls; the copper-gold dragon was too bright for stealth, and the bond stretched thin but held. Through it Kira felt the distant pulse of twelve dragons sleeping in formation, a constellation of warmth against the February cold.

They surfaced inside the castle's lower kitchens just before midnight.

The kitchen was dark, the ovens cold. A single lamp burned in the scullery corridor. Kira pressed herself against the wall and breathed in the smell of old bread and iron pots, and for a disorienting moment she was fourteen again, invisible, beneath notice, safe in the way that only the truly powerless can be safe.

Then she looked down at the dragonmark on her wrist and the moment passed.

"Here." She pressed half the copied letters into Cael's hands. "The laundry women gather before dawn in the east wing basement. They talk to everyone. Maids, footmen, stable boys, kitchen runners. Every servant in the castle will have heard the truth before breakfast."

Cael tucked the letters inside his shirt. "And you?"

"The dragon pens."

---

She knew the way the way blood knows the way through veins.

Three corridors. Two stairwells. A passage behind the armory that smelled of rust and lamp oil. She moved through the sleeping castle like a ghost returning to its haunt, and no one stopped her because no one saw her. Guards stood at the main intersections but the servant routes ran parallel and below, a shadow architecture built for the people who made the visible world function.

The dragon pens were different.

Varek had fortified them. Where there had been open caverns and feeding platforms, there were now iron gates and blood-sigil wards painted in dark red across the stone. Two guards stood at the main entrance, alert, armed with the blood-tipped bolts she'd seen on the walls. She bypassed them through the feed chute, a narrow shaft that dropped from the grain stores into the lower cavern. She'd climbed it a thousand times as a girl, hauling sacks of dried meat for Sorrenvex.

The pens opened around her like a cathedral of stone and heat.

Three dragons remained. Cassian's red, massive and irritable, chained to its roost with links the thickness of a man's arm. Vellant's silver, smaller but faster, sleeping in coils with its tail wrapped around a pillar. And in the deepest alcove, behind wards so thick the air itself seemed to bruise—

A third dragon she didn't recognize.

It was black. Not the black of night or ink but the black of something that had once been another color and had been burned away. Its scales had a sick iridescence, like oil on water. The chains that held it were different from the others: not iron but something that pulsed with a rhythm that matched, horribly, a heartbeat.

Blood-magic chains.

The dragon's eyes opened. They were white. Not blind-white like the Keeper of Echoes but empty-white, the color of a bond that had been scraped out and filled with something else. It looked at Kira and made no sound at all.

She felt her own dragonmark burn.

This was what Varek's blood mages had been building toward. Not just weapons that corrupted bonds. A dragon with no bond at all, no will, no self. A weapon made of flesh and fire and stolen magic, pointed at whatever its master chose.

Kira pressed her hand against the stone and pushed Sorrenvex's memories outward the way the Keeper had taught her. Not through dragonfire this time but through the rock itself, through the deep channels that connected every cavern in the pen system to the volcanic warmth beneath the mountain. She pushed the truth: that bonds were not chains. That the first dragons chose freely. That this abomination was a perversion of everything dragonkind had ever been.

The red dragon stirred. Its chain went taut.

The silver opened one eye.

And the black dragon made a sound. Not a roar. A whimper. The sound of something that remembered what it had been.

She found Marden in the head keeper's quarters.

He was awake. Sitting at his desk with a bottle and a lamp, staring at nothing. He had aged ten years in the weeks since she'd last seen him. The muscle in his jaw worked constantly, grinding something that wasn't food.

He looked up when she stepped through the doorway, and his face did something she'd never seen it do. It crumpled.

"You came back," he said.

Kira closed the door behind her. Her hand rested on the knife at her belt. She hadn't planned to come here. She'd planned to avoid him entirely, to slip through the pens and plant her letters and disappear back through the sewers before dawn. But her feet had carried her to this door the way they'd carried her through every other passage in this castle. Muscle memory. The body remembering what the mind tried to forget.

"The black dragon," she said. "What did they do to it?"

Marden's hand trembled around his bottle. "Lord Cassian's second beast. A young one, barely six years bonded. They took it three weeks ago. Brought it down to the deep chambers with the blood mage and—" He stopped. Drank. "The screaming lasted two days."

"And you let them."

"I'm the head keeper of a king who burns villages." He laughed, and it was the ugliest sound she'd ever heard in a place full of ugly sounds. "What was I going to do, Kira? You ran. You had somewhere to run to. The rest of us just—"

"Stayed."

"Stayed."

She pulled one of the letters from her belt and set it on his desk. He stared at it without touching it.

"The truth about the bonds," she said. "That commoners were the original dragonbonders. That everything this castle was built on is a lie manufactured by blood mages a thousand years ago."

"I know."

The silence that followed was so absolute she could hear the distant breathing of the chained dragons three levels below.

"What?"

"I've been keeper for thirty-one years. I've read every record in the deep archive. I've seen the old texts, the ones they didn't burn." Marden looked at her with eyes that were red-rimmed and exhausted and, for the first time, honest. "I knew what you were the moment Sorrenvex chose you. Not an aberration. A return."

Kira's knife hand shook. "You were going to sell me."

"I was going to survive. Same thing I've done my whole life." He pushed the bottle away. "Survival's gotten expensive."

He picked up the letter. Read it slowly. Set it down.

"There are forty-three servants in this castle who trust me," he said. "Kitchen staff, stablehands, two of the laundry supervisors. If this goes out through my people, it reaches the guilds by midmorning. The guilds reach the merchant quarter. The merchant quarter reaches the gates."

"Why would you help me?"

Marden stood. He was shorter than she remembered, or she had grown.

"Because that thing in the deep pen used to be a dragon named Solace," he said. "She was gentle. She liked it when the stable girls braided flowers into her mane. And they hollowed her out and filled her with poison, and I stood in this room and listened to her scream and did nothing."

He held out his hand. "Give me the rest of the letters."

---

Kira moved through the castle for four hours.

She left letters in the servants' hall, the guards' mess, the temple alcove where the night-shift workers prayed before dawn. She carved the truth into the margins of duty rosters with a pin. She whispered it to a scullery maid she'd known as a child, who whispered it to the woman beside her, who whispered it to the next.

The castle was a machine built on the labor of invisible people, and Kira had been one of them long enough to know exactly which gears to turn.

At the third bell before dawn, she found Cael in the lower kitchens. His letters were gone. His hands were ink-stained. He was grinning like a boy who'd just set fire to something he'd always wanted to burn.

"The laundry women are furious," he said. "In the good way. The head washerwoman said she's been waiting thirty years for someone to say it out loud."

"Marden's distributing through the keeper's network."

Cael's grin faltered. "Marden? The man who tried to sell you?"

"People change when they watch something innocent get destroyed." She thought of Solace, the black dragon with white eyes, and felt her dragonmark pulse. "We need to go. Before the day shift."

They were halfway back to the drainage grate when the bells began.

Not the morning bells. Not the shift-change bells. The warning bells, high and frantic, cascading from tower to tower across the castle complex. Boots hammered on stone above them. Voices shouted orders that echoed and distorted through the tunnel network.

They'd been discovered.

Kira grabbed Cael's arm and ran. The tunnel branched ahead, three directions, and she chose the one that angled down toward the river because down was out and out was alive. Behind them the sound of pursuit funneled into the narrow space, amplified, multiplied, impossible to gauge.

They hit the grate at a sprint. Kira kicked the loosened bars outward and they tumbled into the river, gasping, the cold water hitting like a wall of knives. The current caught them and dragged them downstream, past the chain towers, under the shadow of the walls.

Through the bond she reached for Tempest. Found him. Pulled.

The sky split.

Twelve dragons rose from the camp beyond the walls, their combined roar shaking stones loose from the parapets. Tempest dove for the river, his lightning-eyes blazing, and Kira caught his offered claw as he skimmed the water's surface and was wrenched skyward, Cael on Ember a heartbeat behind her.

Below, the bells kept ringing. But mixed with their clamor, rising from a hundred windows and doorways and servant corridors, was something else. Voices. Hundreds of them. The sound of people who had read the letters, who had heard the truth, who were choosing this moment to stop being invisible.

The servant's war had begun.
